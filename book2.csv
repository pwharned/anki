Iuli Caesaris Commentariorum De Bello Civili, Liber Secundus Dum haec in Hispania geruntur, C|Julius Caesar's Commentaries on the Civil War, Book Two While these things were going on in Spain, C

Trebonius legatus, qui ad oppugnationem Massiliae relictus erat, duabus ex partibus aggerem, vineas turresque ad oppidum agere instituit|Trebonius, the legate, who had been left to attack Marseilles, set up a rampart, vineyards, and towers on two sides to approach the town

una erat proxima portu navalibusque, altera ad portam, qua est aditus ex Gallia atque Hispania, ad id mare, quod adiacet ad ostium Rhodani|one was near the harbor and dockyards, the other at the gate by which there is access from Gaul and Spain to that sea which is adjacent to the mouth of the Rhone

Massilia enim fere tribus ex oppidi partibus mari alluitur; reliqua quarta est, quae aditum habeat ab terra|For Marseilles is watered by the sea on nearly three sides of the town; the remaining quarter is that which has access from the ground

huius quoque spatii pars ea quae ad arcem pertinet, loci natura et valle altissima munita longam et difficilem habet oppugnationem|and that part of this space which belongs to the citadel, being fortified by the nature of the place and the deep valley, has a long and difficult assault

ad ea perficienda opera C|to complete the works C

Trebonius magnam iumentorum atque hominum multitudinem ex omni provincia vocat, vimina materiamque comportari iubet|Trebonius summons a great multitude of cattle and men from every province, and orders them to be brought with them

quibus conparatis rebus aggerem in altitudinem pedum lxxx exstruit|with which things he prepared, he built a mound to the height of 630 feet

Sed tanti erant antiquitus in oppido omnium rerum ad bellum apparatus tantaque multitudo tormentorum, ut eorum vim nullae contextae viminibus vineae sustinere possent|But in ancient times there were in the town so many things prepared for war, and such a multitude of artillery, that no vines woven with vines could withstand their force.

asseres enim pedum xii cuspidibus praefixi atque hi maximis balistis missi per quattuor ordines cratium in terram defigebantur|for the assers were pierced with 11-foot spikes, and these were fixed to the ground with the largest crossbows sent through four rows of bars

itaque pedalibus lignis coniunctis inter se porticus integebantur, atque hac agger inter manus proferebatur|therefore the galleries were covered with wooden pedals joined to each other, and with this the rampart was brought forward between the hands

antecedebat testudo pedum lx aequandi loci causa facta item ex fortissimis lignis, convoluta omnibus rebus, quibus ignis iactus et lapides defendi possent|in front of it was a shell of 100 feet, for the purpose of leveling the place, made also of the strongest wood, wrapped in all things with which fire and stones could be defended

sed magnitudo operum, altitudo muri atque turrium, multitudo tormentorum omnem administrationem tardabat|but the greatness of the works, the height of the wall and the towers, and the multitude of the cannon, retarded all administration

crebrae etiam per Albicos eruptiones fiebant ex oppido, ignesque aggeri et turribus inferebantur|frequent eruptions were also made by the whites from the town, and fires were brought to the ramparts and towers

quae facile nostri milites repellebant magnisque ultro inlatis detrimentis eos, qui eruptionem fecerant, in oppidum reiciebant|which our soldiers easily repulsed, and with great loss inflicted upon them, drove back into the town those who had made the outbreak

Interim L|Meanwhile L

Nasidius ab Cn|Nasidius from Cn

Pompeio cum classe navium ivx, in quibus paucae erant aeratae, L|Pompey with a fleet of 49 ships, of which few were damaged, L

Domitio Massiliensibusque subsidio missus freto Siciliae imprudente atque inopinante Curione pervehitur adpulsisque Messanam navibus atque inde propter repentinum terrorem principum ac senatus fuga facta ex navalibus eorum navem deducit|Domitius, having been sent to the aid of the Massilians, unwittingly and unexpectedly crossed the coast of Sicily to Curio, and attacked Messana with his ships;

hac adiuncta ad reliquas naves cursum Massiliam versus perficit praemissaque clam navicula Domitium Massiliensisque de suo adventu certiores facit eosque magnopere hortatur, ut rursus cum Bruti classe additis suis auxiliis confligant|having joined the rest of the ships, he completes his course towards Marseilles, and secretly informs the ships of Domitius of Marseilles of his arrival, and strongly urges them to engage again with the fleet of Brutus, with the addition of their auxiliaries.

Massilienses post superius incommodum veteres ad eundem numerum ex navalibus productas navis refecerant summaque industria armaverant—remigum, gubernatorum magna copia subpetebat— piscatoriasque adiecerant atque contexerant, ut essent ab ictu telorum remiges tuti; has sagittariis tormentisque conpleverunt|After the above inconvenience, the old men of Marseilles had repaired to the same number of ships produced from the shipyards, and had armed them with the utmost diligence—a great number of sailors and pilots were in demand—and they had added fishing nets and built them together, so that the crews would be protected from the blows of the guns; they completed these with archers and artillery

tali modo instructa classe omnium seniorum, matrum familiae, virginum precibus et fletu excitati, extremo tempore civitati subvenirent, non minore animo ac fiducia quam ante dimicaverant, naves conscendunt|In this manner the fleet of all the elders, the mothers of the families, and the mothers of the families, roused by the prayers and cries of the virgins, were to come to the aid of the state at the last moment, with no less courage and confidence than they had fought before, and embarked on ships.

communi enim fit vitio naturae, ut invisitatis atque incognitis rebus magis confidamus vehementiusque exterreamur; ut tum accidit|for it is a common vice of nature, that we trust more and are more afraid of things unseen and unknown; as it happened then

adventus enim L|for the arrival of L

Nasidi summa spe et voluntate civitatem conpleverat|Nasidi had completed the city with the utmost hope and desire

nacti idoneum ventum ex portu exeunt et Tauroenta, quod est castellum Massiliensium, ad Nasidium perveniunt ibique naves expediunt rursusque se ad confligendum animo confirmant et consilia communicant|having obtained a suitable wind, they leave the harbor and arrive at Tauroenta, which is the fort of the Massilians.

dextra pars attribuitur Massiliensibus, sinistra Nasidio|the right part is attributed to the Massilians, the left to the Nasidians

Eodem Brutus contendit aucto navium numero|The same Brutus contended with an increased number of ships

nam ad eas, quae factae erant Arelate per Caesarem, captivae Massiliensium accesserant sex|for to those which had been made at Arelate by Caesar, six prisoners of the Massilians had come

has superioribus diebus refecerat atque omnibus rebus instruxerat|these he had restored in former days, and furnished them with all things

itaque suos cohortatus, quos integros superavissent, ut victos contemnerent, plenus spei bonae atque animi adversus eos proficiscitur|therefore, having encouraged his men, whom they had overcome whole, to despise the vanquished, he set out against them, full of good hope and spirit.

facile erat ex castris C|it was easy from camp C

Treboni atque omnibus superioribus locis prospicere in urbem, ut omnis iuventus, quae in oppido remanserat, omnesque superioris aetatis cum liberis atque uxoribus †publicis custodiisque† aut muro ad caelum manus tenderent aut templa deorum immortalium adirent et ante simulacra proiecti victoriam ab dis exposcerent|Treboni and all the higher places looked towards the city, so that all the youth who remained in the town, and all those of an older age with their children and wives and †public guards† either stretched out their hands to heaven on the wall, or went to the temples of the immortal gods, and before the effigies thrown down, they expounded the victory from the push

neque erat quisquam omnium, quin in eius diei casu suarum omnium fortunarum eventum consistere existimaret|and there was no one of all who did not think that the outcome of all his fortunes rested on the chance of that day

nam et honesti ex iuventute et cuiusque aetatis amplissimi nominatim evocati atque obsecrati navis conscenderant, ut siquid adversi accidisset, ne ad conandum quidem sibi quicquam reliqui fore viderent; si superavissent, vel domesticis opibus vel externis auxiliis de salute urbis confiderent|for the most honorable of the youth, and the greatest of every age, had been summoned by name and begged to embark on board the ship, so that whatever adversity might befall them, they did not see that there would be anything left for them to attempt; if they had survived, they would have trusted either to their domestic resources or to foreign aid for the safety of the city

Commisso proelio Massiliensibus res nulla ad virtutem defuit|When the battle was committed to the people of Marseilles, nothing was wanting for their valour

sed memores eorum praeceptorum, quae paulo ante ab suis acceperant, hoc animo decertabant, ut nullum aliud tempus ad conandum habituri viderentur, et quibus in pugna vitae periculum accideret, non ita multo se reliquorum civium fatum antecedere existimarent, quibus urbe capta eadem esset belli fortuna patienda|but remembering the instructions which they had received a little before from their own men, they fought with such a mind that they seemed to have no other time to try, and to those whose lives would be in danger in the battle, they did not think themselves so far in advance of the fate of the rest of the citizens, who, having taken the city, would have the same fate of war to suffer

diductisque nostris paulatim navibus et artificio gubernatorum et mobilitati navium locus dabatur, et siquando nostri facultatem nacti ferreis manibus iniectis navem religaverant, undique suis laborantibus succurrebant|and having led our ships, little by little, space was given to the skill of the pilots and the mobility of the ships;

neque vero coniuncti Albici comminus pugnando deficiebant neque multum cedebant virtute nostris|nor did the united whites fail to fight at close quarters, nor did they yield much to our strength

simul ex minoribus navibus magna vis eminus missa telorum multa nostris de improviso imprudentibus atque inpeditis vulnera inferebant|At the same time, a large force of guns was sent from the smaller ships at a distance, and they inflicted many wounds on our unsuspecting and disabled men.

conspicataeque naves triremes duae navem D|and two triremes were seen, the ship D

Bruti, quae ex insigni facile agnosci poterat, duabus ex partibus sese in eam incitaverant|The brutes, which could be easily recognized by their insignia, had forced themselves upon it from two sides

sed tantum re provisa Brutus celeritate navis enisus est ut parvo momento antecederet|but Brutus having only provided for the matter, the speed of the ship was so great that he was a little ahead

illae adeo graviter inter se incitatae conflixerunt, ut vehementissime utraque ex concursu laborarent, altera vero praefracto rostro tota conlabefieret|and these, being greatly incited, fought with each other, so that both of them suffered most violently from the collision, while the other, with his broken beak, fell down entirely.

qua re animadversa, quae proximae ei loco ex Bruti classe naves erant, in eas inpeditas impetum faciunt celeriterque ambas deprimunt|which being noticed, which were the ships of Brutus's fleet nearest to him, made a heavy attack upon them, and speedily sank them both

Sed Nasidianae naves nullo usui fuerunt celeriterque pugna excesserunt|But the Nasidian ships were of no use, and the battle was soon over

non enim has aut conspectus patriae aut propinquorum praecepta ad extre mum vitae periculum adire cogebant|for neither the view of their country nor the precepts of their relatives compelled them to risk their lives to the extreme

itaque ex eo numero navium nulla desiderata est; ex Massiliensium classe v sunt depressae, iiii captae, una cum Nasidianis profugit; quae omnes citeriorem Hispaniam petiverunt|and therefore none of that number of ships was wanting; 5 of the Massilian fleet were defeated, 3 were captured, and fled together with the Nasidians; all of which asked for better Spain

at ex reliquis una praemissa Massiliam huius nuntii perferendi gratia cum iam adpropinquaret urbi, omnis sese multitudo ad cognoscendum effudit, et re cognita tantus luctus excepit, ut urbs ab hostibus capta eodem vestigio videretur|but one of the rest, having been given the grace of carrying this news to Marseilles, when it was already nearing the city, the whole multitude poured out to make it known, and when the matter was learned, there was such great mourning, that the city was seen taken by the enemy by the same trail.

Massilienses tamen nihilo setius ad defensionem urbis reliqua apparare coeperunt|The inhabitants of Marseilles, however, began to prepare nothing more for the defense of the rest of the city

Est animadversum ab legionariis, qui dextram partem operis administrabant, ex crebris hostium eruptionibus magno sibi esse praesidio posse, si ibi pro castello ac receptaculo turrim ex latere sub muro fecissent|It was noticed by the legionaries, who were in charge of the right part of the work, that they could be greatly protected from the frequent eruptions of the enemy, if there they had made a tower on the side under the wall for a castle and shelter

quam primo ad repentinos incursus humilem parvamque fecerunt|which at first they made low and small for sudden attacks

huc se referebant; hinc, siqua maior oppresserat vis, propugnabant; hinc ad repellendum et prosequendum hostem procurrebant|they referred to this; hence, as if a greater force had oppressed them, they defended themselves; hence they ran to repulse and pursue the enemy

patebat haec quoquoversus pedes xxx, sed parietum crassitudo pedes v|These were open on every side 30 feet, but the thickness of the walls was 5 feet

postea vero, ut est rerum omnium magister usus, hominum adhibita sollertia inventum est magno esse usui posse, si haec esset in altitudinem turris elata|but afterwards, as use is the teacher of all things, it was found that the skill employed by men would be of great use, if it were raised to the height of a tower

id hac ratione perfectum est|it is perfect in this way

Ubi turris altitudo perducta est ad contabulationem, eam in parietes instruxerunt, ita ut capita tignorum extrema parietum structura tegerentur, nequid emineret, ubi ignis hostium adhaeresceret|When the height of the tower was brought up to the buttress, they set it up against the walls, so that the ends of the beams were covered by the structure of the walls, so that nothing would project where the fire of the enemy would stick.

hanc insuper contignationem, quantum tectum plutei ac vinearum passum est, latericulo adstruxerunt supraque eum locum duo tigna transversa iniecerunt non longe ab extremis parietibus, quibus suspenderent eam contignationem quae turri tegimento esset futura, supraque ea tigna derecto transversas trabes iniecerunt easque axibus religaverunt|this floor, in addition, as far as the roof of the shelf and the vines passed, they built up with brick, and above that place they threw two transverse beams not far from the extreme walls, by which they would suspend the floor which was to be the roof of the tower, and directly above these beams they threw transverse beams and tied them with axes

has trabes paulo longiores atque eminentiores quam extremi parietes erant, effecerunt ut esset ubi tegimenta praependere possent ad defendendos ictus ac repellendos, cum infra eam contignationem parietes extruerentur; eamque contabulationem summam lateribus lutoque constraverunt, nequid ignis hostium nocere posset, centonesque insuper iniecerunt, ne aut tela tormentis missa tabulationem perfringerent, aut saxa ex catapultis latericium discuterent|these beams were a little longer and more prominent than the outermost walls, and they made it so that there was a place where they could overhang the roofs to defend and repulse blows, when the walls were built below that floor. and they built up the top of the foundation with bricks and mud, so that the fire of the enemy could not harm them, and they threw in mortars, so that either the cannonballs shot through the foundation, or the stones from the catapults scattered the bricks.

storias autem ex funibus ancorariis tres in longitudinem parietum turris latas iiii pedes fecerunt easque ex tribus partibus quae ad hostes vergebant, eminentibus trabibus circum turrim praependentes religaverunt; quod unum genus tegimenti aliis locis erant experti nullo telo neque tormento traici posse|and they made stories from the anchor ropes three feet wide in the length of the walls of the tower, and tied them from the three sides which were towards the enemy, to projecting beams overhanging around the tower. that one kind of shelter they had experienced in other places could not be penetrated with any weapon or cannon

ubi vero ea pars turris, quae erat perfecta, tecta atque munita est ab omni ictu hostium, pluteos ad alia opera abduxerunt; turris tectum per se ipsum pressionibus ex contignatione prima suspendere ac tollere coeperunt|but when that part of the tower, which was complete, was covered and protected from every blow of the enemy, they removed the shelves to other works; the roof of the tower began to suspend and lift itself from the pressure of the first floor

ubi quantum storiarum demissio patiebatur, tantum elevarant, intra haec tegimenta abditi atque muniti parietes lateribus exstruebant, rursusque alia pressione ad aedificandum sibi locum expediebant|where, as far as the lowering of the stories was permitted, they raised it as much as they could; within these shelters they hid and fortified the walls with bricks, and again by other pressures they prepared a place for themselves

ubi tempus alterius contabulationis videbatur, tigna item ut primo tecta extremis lateribus instruebant exque ea contignatione rursus summam contabulationem storiasque elevabant|when the time for another rafter was in sight, the beams were also arranged at the extreme sides of the roof as at first, and from that floor they again raised the top rafter

ita tuto ac sine ullo vulnere ac periculo vi tabulata exstruxerunt fenestrasque, quibus in locis visum est, ad tormenta mittenda in struendo reliquerunt|thus safely and without any injury or danger they built the floors by force, and left the windows in the places where they saw fit to send the guns in the building.

Ubi ex ea turri quae circum essent opera tueri se posse sunt confisi, musculum pedes lx longum ex materia bipedali, quem a turri latericia ad hostium turrim murumque perducerent, facere instituerunt|When they were confident that they could protect themselves from the works of the tower that were around them, they planned to make a muscle 100 feet long of bipedal material, which they would lead from the bricks of the tower to the enemy's tower and wall.

cuius musculi haec erat forma|whose muscle was this form

duae primum trabes in solo aeque longae distantes inter se pedes iiii collocantur inque eis columellae pedum in altitudinem v defiguntur|two first beams are placed on the ground, at a distance of iii feet from each other, and on them are fixed the columns of feet to a height of v

has inter se capreolis molli fastigio coniungunt, ubi tigna quae musculi tegendi causa ponant collocentur|these are connected to each other by a soft ridge, where the logs which they put for the purpose of covering the muscles are placed

eo super tigna bipedalia iniciunt eaque laminis clavisque religant|upon it they cast two-footed beams, and fasten them with plates and keys

ad extremum musculi tectum trabesque extremas quadratas regulas iiii patentis digitos defigunt, quae lateres, qui super musculo struantur, contineant|at the extremity of the muscle roof and beams fix the extreme square rules iii open fingers, which contain the sides that are built over the muscle

ita fastigato atque ordinatim structo ut trabes erant in capreolis collocatae, lateribus lutoque musculus, ut ab igni qui ex muro iaceretur tutus esset, contegitur|It was built in such a way that the beams were placed in the rafters, and the walls were covered with mud and mud, so that it would be safe from the fire that was thrown from the wall.

super lateres coria inducuntur, ne canalibus aqua immissa lateres diluere posset|skins are introduced over the bricks, so that the water entering the canals could not dilute the bricks

coria autem ne rursus igni ac lapidibus corrumpantur, centonibus conteguntur|and the hides are covered with rags, lest they should again be corrupted by fire and stones

hoc opus omne tectum vineis ad ipsam turrim perficiunt subitoque inopinantibus hostibus machinatione navali phalangis subiectis ad turrim hostium admovent, ut aedificio iungatur|they complete this work with vines all the way to the tower itself, and suddenly, unexpected by the enemy, they advance to the enemy's tower, under the artillery of the naval phalanx, so that it may be joined to the building

Quo malo perterriti subito oppidani saxa, quam maxima possunt, vectibus promovent, praecipitataque muro in musculum devolvunt|The townspeople, suddenly terrified by this evil, push forward the stones as large as they can with poles, and roll them down upon the wall upon the wall.

ictum firmitas materiae sustinet, et quidquid incidit, fastigio musculi elabitur|the firmness of the material sustains the blow, and whatever falls, the summit of the muscle slips away

id ubi vident, mutant consilium; cupas taeda ac pice refertas incendunt easque de muro in musculum devolvunt|when they see that, they change their plan; they set fire to the casks filled with wood and pitch, and roll them from the wall into the muscle

involutae labuntur, delapsae ab lateribus longuriis furcisque ab opere removentur|they are rolled up and slid down, the long sides and the forks are removed from the work

interim sub musculo milites vectibus infima saxa turris hostium, quibus fundamenta continebantur, convellunt|Meanwhile, the soldiers under their swords were tearing down the lowest rocks of the enemy's tower, by which the foundations were held

musculus ex turri latericia a nostris telis tormentisque defenditur; hostes ex muro ac turribus submoventur; non datur libera muri defendendi facultas|the muscle of the brick tower is defended by our guns and artillery; the enemies are removed from the wall and towers; he is not given a free chance to defend the wall

conpluribus iam lapidibus ex illa quae suberat turri subductis repentina ruina pars eius turris concidit, pars reliqua consequens procumbebat, cum hostes urbis direptione perterriti inermes cum infulis se porta foras universi proripiunt, ad legatos atque exercitum supplices manus tendunt|After several stones had already been carried away from that which was under the tower, a part of the tower collapsed in a sudden fall, and the rest of the consequent part fell down, when the enemies, terrified by the plundering of the city, and unarmed, with the assailants, rushed out of the gate, and stretched out their hands in supplication to the legates and the army.

Qua nova re oblata omnis administratio belli consistit, militesque aversi a proelio ad studium audiendi et cognoscendi feruntur|With this new matter presented, all the administration of war ceases, and the soldiers are diverted from the battle to the study of hearing and learning

ubi hostes ad legatos exercitumque pervenerunt, universi se ad pedes proiciunt; orant, ut adventus Caesaris expectetur|when the enemy reached the ambassadors and the army, they all threw themselves at their feet; they pray that Caesar's arrival may be expected

captam suam urbem videre, opera perfecta, turrim subrutam; itaque ab defensione desistere|to see his city taken, the works completed, the tower destroyed; therefore to desist from the defence

nullam exoriri moram posse, quominus cum venisset, si imperata non facerent ad nutum, e vestigio diriperentur|that there could be no delay, lest, when he came, if they did not carry out the orders at the signal, they would be thrown off the track

docent, si omnino turris concidisset, non posse milites contineri, quin spe praedae in urbem inrumperent urbemque delerent|they teach that, if the tower had completely fallen, the soldiers could not be held back, without hoping to break into the city and destroy the city

haec atque eiusdem generis complura ut ab hominibus doctis magna cum misericordia fletuque pronuntiantur|these, and many others of the same kind, may be uttered by learned men with great compassion and weeping

Quibus rebus commoti legati milites ex opere deducunt, oppugnatione desistunt; operibus custodias relinquunt|The ambassadors, moved by these things, withdrew the soldiers from their work, and desisted from the attack; they leave the guards at work

indutiarum quodam genere misericordia facto adventus Caesaris expectatur|the coming of Caesar is awaited, having been clothed in a kind of mercy

nullum ex muro, nullum a nostris mittitur telum; ut re confecta omnes curam et diligentiam remittunt|no weapon is sent from the wall, no weapon from ours; when the matter is finished, all care and attention are returned

Caesar enim per litteras Trebonio magnopere mandaverat, ne per vim oppidum expugnari pateretur, ne gravius permoti milites et defectionis odio et contemptione sui et diutino labore omnes puberes interficerent; quod se facturos minabantur aegreque tunc sunt retenti, quin oppidum inrumperent, graviterque eam rem tulerunt, quod stetisse per Trebonium, quominus oppido potirentur, videbatur|For Caesar, by letter, had strongly commanded Trebonius that the town should not be allowed to be stormed by force, lest the soldiers, more deeply moved by the hatred and contempt of the desertion, and of their long labors, should kill all the young men; which they threatened to do, and then they were with difficulty restrained from breaking into the town, and they took the matter seriously, because it was seen that they had stood by Trebonium, from which they could take possession of the town

At hostes sine fide tempus atque occasionem fraudis ac doli quaerunt, interiectisque aliquot diebus, nostris languentibus atque animo remissis, subito meridiano tempore, cum alius discessisset, alius ex diutino labore in ipsis operibus quieti se dedisset, arma vero omnia reposita contectaque essent, portis se foras erumpunt, secundo magnoque vento ignem operibus inferunt|But the enemy without faith seek a time and an opportunity for fraud and deceit, and after several days' intervening, our languishing and spirited, suddenly at noon, when one had departed, and another had retired from long labor in the works themselves, but all the weapons had been stored and covered, the gates were closed they burst forth, and a second great wind brought fire to the works

hunc sic distulit ventus, uti uno tempore agger plutei testudo turris tormenta flammam conciperent et prius haec omnia consumerentur, quam quemadmodum accidisset, animadverti posset|This was so carried away by the wind, that at one time the ramparts of the ramparts and the tortoise-shell of the tower caught fire, and all this was consumed before it could be noticed how it had happened.

nostri repentina fortuna permoti arma quae possunt adripiunt, alii ex castris sese incitant|Ours, moved by our sudden fortune, seize what weapons they can, and others from the camp incite themselves

fit in hostis impetus eorum, sed de muro sagittis tormentisque fugientes persequi prohibentur|an attack is made on their enemy, but they are prevented from pursuing those fleeing from the wall by arrows and cannons

illi sub murum se recipiunt ibique musculum turrimque latericiam libere incendunt|they withdraw themselves under the wall, and there they freely set fire to the brickwork of the tower

ita multorum mensum labor hostium perfidia et vi tempestatis puncto temporis interiit|and so the labor of many men was destroyed at the point of time by the treachery of the enemy and by the force of the storm

temptaverunt hoc idem Massilienses postero die|The people of Marseilles tried the same thing the next day

eandem nacti tempestatem maiore cum fiducia ad alteram turrim aggeremque eruptione pugnaverunt multumque ignem intulerunt|and having encountered the same storm, they fought with greater confidence by breaking out into the other tower and rampart, and brought a great deal of fire

sed ut superioris temporis contentionem nostri omnem remiserant, ita proximi diei casu admoniti omnia ad defensionem paraverant|but as they had remitted all our strife of the former season, so being warned of the danger of the next day, they had prepared everything for the defense

itaque multis interfectis reliquos infecta re in oppidum reppulerunt|therefore, having killed many, they drove the rest into the town, infected by the disease

Trebonius ea quae sunt amissa multo maiore militum studio administrare et reficere instituit|Trebonius set about managing and restoring what had been lost with much greater military diligence

nam ubi tantos suos labores et apparatus male cecidisse viderunt, indutiisque per scelus violatis suam virtutem inrisui fore perdoluerunt, quod, unde agger omnino conportari posset, nihil erat reliquum, omnibus arboribus longe lateque in finibus Massiliensium excisis et convectis, aggerem novi generis atque inauditum ex latericiis duobus muris senum pedum crassitudine atque eorum murorum contignatione facere instituerunt aequa fere altitudine, atque ille congesticius ex materia fuerat agger|for when they saw that so many of their labors and equipment had failed miserably, and having been clothed with the crime of violating their valour, they regretted that their valor would be laughed at, because there was nothing left from which the rampart could be carried at all; They planned to make two walls of brick with the thickness of an old foot, and the floor of their walls was almost equal in height, and that had been a pile of congested material

ubi aut spatium inter muros aut imbecillitas materiae postulare videretur, pilae interponuntur, traversaria tigna iniciuntur, quae firmamento esse possint, et quidquid est contignatum, cratibus consternitur, crates luto integuntur|where either a space between the walls or the weakness of the material seemed to be required, piles are interposed, and cross-beams are thrown in, which may serve as a foundation;

sub tecto miles dextra ac sinistra muro tectus, adversus plutei obiectu, operi quaecumque sunt usui, sine periculo subportat|Under the roof, the soldier, sheltered by the wall on the right and left, against the object of the shelf, supports the work of whatever use it may be without danger.

celeriter res administratur; diuturni laboris detrimentum sollertia et virtute militum brevi reconciliatur|things are quickly managed; The loss of long labor is soon reconciled by the skill and valor of the soldiers

portae, quibus locis videtur, eruptionis causa in muro relinquuntur|the gates, in which places it seems, were left in the wall because of the eruption

Quod ubi hostes viderunt, ea, quae diu longoque spatio refici non posse sperassent, paucorum dierum opera et labore ita refecta, ut nullus perfidiae neque eruptioni locus esset, neque quicquam omnino relinqueretur, qua aut telis militibus aut igni operibus noceri posset, eodemque exemplo sentiunt totam urbem, qua sit aditus ab terra, muro turribusque circumiri posse, sic ut ipsis consistendi in suis munitionibus locus non esset, cum paene inaedificata in muris ab exercitu nostro moenia viderentur, ac telum manu coiceretur, suorumque tormentorum usum, quibus ipsi magna speravissent, spatii propinquitate interire parique condicione ex muro ac turribus bellandi data se virtute nostris adaequare non posse intellegunt, ad easdem deditionis condiciones recurrunt|And when the enemy saw, those things which they had hoped could not be restored for a long and long distance, were restored by the work and labor of a few days, in such a way that there was no room for treachery, nor for an eruption, nor was anything left at all, by which either the weapons of the soldiers or the works of fire could be harmed, and they felt the same example. the whole city, to which there was an approach from the ground, could be surrounded by a wall and towers, so that there would be no place for them to stand in their fortifications, when the walls were seen by our army almost unbuilt on the walls, and the weapons were cast by hand, and the use of their cannons, in which they had greatly hoped. to perish by the proximity of the space, and given the equal condition of the wall and towers of war, they realize that they cannot equal our power, they resort to the same terms of surrender

erant, qui censerent de tertia vigilia in Castra Cornelia recedendum, ut maiore spatio temporis interiecto militum mentes sanarentur, simul siquid gravius accidisset, magna multitudine navium et tutius et facilius in Siciliam receptus daretur|there were those who thought that on the third watch we should retire to the camp of Cornelia, so that after a greater space of time the minds of the soldiers might be healed;

Curio utrumque improbans consilium, quantum alteri sententiae deesset animi, tantum alteri superesse dicebat; hos turpissimae fugae rationem habere, illos etiam iniquo loco dimicandum putare|The court, disapproving both counsels, said that as much as the opinion of the other lacked the spirit, so much as the other survived; to regard these as the most disgraceful flight, and to think that they should also fight in an unjust place

'qua enim,' inquit, 'fiducia et opere et natura loci munitissima castra expugnari posse confidimus? aut vero quid proficimus, si accepto magno detrimento ab oppugnatione castrorum discedimus? quasi non et felicitas rerum gestarum exercitus benevolentiam imperatoribus et res adversae odia concilient! castrorum autem mutatio quid habet nisi turpem fugam et desperationem omnium et alienationem exercitus? nam neque pudentis suspicari oportet sibi parum credi neque improbos scire sese timeri, quod illis licentiam timor augeat noster, his studia deminuat|'For with what confidence,' he says, 'do we trust that the most fortified camp of the place can be stormed? Or indeed, what do we gain if we withdraw from the attack on the camp after receiving a great loss? as if the happiness of the achievements of the army did not win the goodwill of the emperors, and the adverse events conquer the hatred! But what does the change of camps have but the disgraceful flight and despair of all, and the alienation of the army? for the shameless must not be suspected of having little faith in themselves, nor should the unscrupulous know themselves to be feared, lest our fear increase their license, and diminish their studies

quod si iam,' inquit, 'haec explorata habeamus, quae de exercitus alienatione dicuntur, quae quidem ego aut omnino falsa aut certe minora opinione esse confido, quanto haec dissimulari et occultari, quam per nos confirmari praestet? an non, uti corporis vulnera, ita exercitus incommoda sunt tegenda, ne spem adversariis augeamus? at etiam, ut media nocte proficiscamur, addunt, quo maiorem, credo, licentiam habeant, qui peccare conentur|that if we have already,' says he, 'scrutinized these things, which are said of the alienation of the army, which indeed I trust to be either entirely false, or at least a lesser opinion, how much more can these things be disguised and concealed than can be confirmed by us? or not, like the wounds of the body, so that armies are inconvenient to cover, lest we should increase the hope of our adversaries? but also, that we should set out at midnight, they add, so much the greater, I believe, that those who attempt to sin should have a license

namque huiusmodi res aut pudore aut metu tenentur, quibus rebus nox maxime adversaria est|for such things are held either by shame or fear, to which things the night is most hostile

quare neque tanti sum animi, ut sine spe castra obpugnanda censeam, neque tanti timoris, uti spe deficiam, atque omnia prius experienda arbitror magnaque ex parte iam me una vobiscum de re iudicium facturum confido|wherefore I am neither of such a mind as to consider the camp to be attacked without hope, nor of such fear as to fail in hope;

' Dimisso consilio contionem advocat militum|Dismissing the council, he advocated the meeting of the soldiers

commemorat, quo sit eorum usus studio ad Corfinium Caesar, ut magnam partem Italiae beneficio atque auctoritate eorum suam fecerit|He mentions how Caesar used them in his pursuit of Corfinium, so that he made a large part of Italy his own by their favor and influence

'vos enim vestrumque factum,' inquit, 'omnia deinceps municipia sunt secuta, neque sine causa et Caesar amicissime de vobis et illi gravissime iudicaverunt|"For you and your deed," said he, "all the municipalities followed suit, and not without cause, and Caesar, in a most friendly manner, judged you and them very severely."

Pompeius enim nullo proelio pulsus vestri facti praeiudicio demotus Italia excessit; Caesar me, quem sibi carissimum habuit, provinciam Siciliam atque Africam, sine quibus urbem atque Italiam tueri non potest, vestrae fidei commisit|For Pompey, defeated in no battle, left Italy, humbled by the prejudice you had committed; Caesar entrusted me, whom he held dearest to him, the province of Sicily and Africa, without which he cannot defend the city and Italy, to your faith

at sunt qui vos hortentur, ut a nobis desciscatis|but there are those who urge you to learn from us

quid enim est illis optatius quam uno tempore et nos circumvenire et vos nefario scelere obstringere? aut quid irati gravius de vobis sentire possunt, quam ut eos prodatis, qui se vobis omnia debere iudicant, in eorum potestatem veniatis, qui se per vos perisse existimant? an vero in Hispania res gestas Caesaris non audistis? duos pulsos exercitus, duos superatos duces, duas receptas provincias? haec acta diebus xl, quibus in conspectum adversariorum venerit Caesar? an qui incolumes resistere non potuerunt, perditi resistant? vos autem incerta victoria Caesarem secuti diiudicata iam belli fortuna victum sequamini, cum vestri officii praemia percipere debeatis? desertos enim se ac proditos a vobis dicunt et prioris sacramenti mentionem faciunt|for what is more desirable to them than to encircle us at one time and bind you with a wicked crime? or what can the angry feel more grievously about you, than that you have sold them, who judge that they owe you everything, to come into the power of those who think that they have perished through you? Have you not heard of Caesar's deeds in Spain? two defeated armies, two vanquished leaders, two recovered provinces? These things took place in the 40 days in which Caesar came into the presence of his adversaries? Or do those who could not resist unscathed resist? but you, having succeeded Caesar in an uncertain victory, having already been decided by the fortunes of war, the victory of Sequaminus, when should you receive the rewards of your office? for they say they are deserted and betrayed by you, and they make mention of the former sacrament

vosne vero L|vosne vero L

Domitium, an vos Domitius deseruit? nonne extremam pati fortunam paratos proiecit ille? non sibi clam vobis salutem fuga petivit? non proditi per illum Caesaris benef ficio estis conservati? sacramento quidem vos tenere qui potuit, cum proiectis fascibus et deposito imperio privatus et captus ipse in alienam venisset potestatem? [10] relinquitur nova religio, ut eo neglecto sacramento, quo tenemini, respiciatis illud, quod deditione ducis et [11] capitis deminutione sublatum est|Domitius, or has Domitius forsaken you? did he not throw them out ready to suffer the extreme fate? Did he not secretly ask you for safety by flight? Were you not betrayed and preserved by Caesar's beneficence? Indeed, who could hold you in the sacrament, when, having been thrown out with bundles and entrusted with the government, deprived and taken prisoner, he himself had come into the power of another? [10] the new religion is left behind, so that, neglecting the sacrament which you hold, you may respect that which was removed by the surrender of the leader and [11] the demotion of the head

at, credo, si Caesarem probatis, in me offenditis|but, I believe, if you have tried Caesar, you have stumbled upon me

qui de meis in vos meritis praedicaturus non sum, quae sunt adhuc et mea voluntate et vestra exspectatione leviora; sed tamen sui laboris milites semper eventu belli praemia petiverunt, qui qualis sit futurus, ne vos quidem dubitatis|I am not going to preach to you about my merits, which are still lighter both by my will and by your expectations. but nevertheless the soldiers of their own labor have always sought rewards in the event of the war, of what kind it will be, even you do not doubt

diligentiam quidem nostram aut, quem ad finem [12] adhuc res processit, fortunam cur praeteream? an paenitet vos, quod salvum atque incolumem exercitum nulla omnino navi desiderata traduxerim? quod classem hostium primo impetu adveniens profligaverim? quod bis per biduum equestri proelio superaverim? quod ex portu sinuque adversariorum cc naves oneratas abduxerim eoque illos compulerim, ut neque pedestri itinere neque navibus commeatu iuvari possint? [13] hac vos fortuna atque his ducibus repudiatis Corfiniensem ignominiam, Italiae fugam, an Hispaniarum deditionem, inAfrici belli praeiudicia sequimini! [14] equidem me Caesaris militem dici volui, vos me imperatoris nomine appellavistis|Indeed, why should we pass over our diligence, or, to the end [12] of which the matter has yet progressed, fortune? or do you regret that I did not bring the army safe and unharmed in any ship that was desired at all? that when I first attacked the enemy's fleet, I should have defeated it? that twice in two days I had overcome the cavalry? that I had taken 100 laden ships from the harbor and pocket of the adversaries, and driven them there, so that neither the pedestrians could be helped to travel nor the ships to supply them? [13] With this fortune, and having rejected these leaders, pursue the disgrace of Corfina, the flight of Italy, or the capitulation of Spain, the prejudices of the war in Africa! [14] Indeed, I wanted to be called Caesar's soldier, but you called me by the name of emperor

cuius si vos paenitet, vestrum vobis beneficium remitto, mihi meum restituite nomen, ne ad contumeliam honorem dedisse videamini|if you repent, I will forgive you your favor, restore to me my name, so that you do not seem to have given honor to insult

' Qua oratione permoti milites crebro etiam dicentem interpellabant, ut magno cum dolore infidelitatis suspicionem sustinere viderentur, discedentem vero ex contione universi cohortantur, magno sit animo neubi dubitet proelium committere et suam fidem virtutemque experiri|Moved by this prayer, the soldiers frequently interrupted him who was speaking, so that they might be seen to bear the suspicion of infidelity with great pain, but they all encouraged him who was departing from the assembly, that he should be of great courage and never hesitate to undertake the battle, and test his faith and valor

quo facto commutata omnium et voluntate et opinione consensu suorum constituit Curio, cum primum sit data potestas, proelio rem committere, posteroque die productos eodem loco, quo superioribus diebus constiterat, in acie collocat|which being exchanged, and with the consent of all, and the will and opinion of his people, the Curia, as soon as the power was given him, determined to commit the matter to battle, and on the following day placed the products in the same place in which they had stood in the preceding days.

ne Varus quidem Attius dubitat copias producere, sive sollicitandi milites sive aequo loco dimicandi detur occasio, ne facultatem praetermittat|even Varus Attius does not hesitate to produce troops, whether an opportunity is given to solicit the soldiers or to fight on a level ground, so that he does not pass up the opportunity

Erat vallis inter duas acies, ut supra demonstratum est, non ita magna, at difficili et arduo ascensu|There was a valley between the two lines, as has been pointed out above, not so great, but a difficult and steep ascent

hanc uterque si adversariorum copiae transire conarentur, expectabat, quo aequiore loco proelium committeret|each of them, if the forces of the adversaries tried to cross, waited for them to commit the battle in a more equal place

simul ab sinistro cornu P|at the same time from the left wing of P

Atti equitatus omnis et una levis armaturae interiecti conplures, cum se in vallem demitterent, cernebantur|At that time all the cavalry and one of the light armor were killed, and several of them were seen as they descended into the valley.

ad eos Curio equitatum et duas Marrucinorum cohortis mittit; quorum primum impetum equites hostium non tulerunt, sed admissis equis ad suos refugerunt; relicti ab his, qui una procurrerant levis armaturae, circumveniebantur atque interficiebantur ab nostris|to them Curius sends cavalry and two cohorts of Marrucines; the first charge of which the horsemen of the enemy did not bear, but having admitted their horses, took refuge with their own men; abandoned by those who had run together with the light armour, they were surrounded and slain by our men

huc tota Vari conversa acies suos fugere et concidi videbat|hither the whole of Vari turned, and saw his troops fleeing and cut down

tum Rebilus, legatus Caesaris, quem Curio secum ex Sicilia duxerat, quod magnum habere usum in re militari sciebat, 'perterritum' inquit 'hostem vides, Curio; quid dubitas uti temporis opportunitate?' ille unum elocutus, ut memoria tenerent milites ea quae pridie sibi confirmassent, sequi se iubet et praecurrit ante omnes|Then Rebilus, Caesar's legate, whom Curius had brought with him from Sicily, because he knew that he would be of great use in military affairs, said in terror, 'You see the enemy, Curius; why do you hesitate to take advantage of the time?' he having said one thing, that the soldiers might remember what they had confirmed to them the day before, ordered them to follow him, and went ahead of them all

adeoque erat impedita vallis, ut in ascensu nisi sublevati a suis primi non facile eniterentur|and it was so obstructed by the valley, that they could not easily proceed in the ascent unless relieved by their first men

sed praeoccupatus animus Attianorum militum timore et fuga et caede suorum nihil de resistendo cogitabat, omnesque iam se ab equitatu circumveniri arbitrabantur|but the mind of the Attian soldiers, preoccupied with fear and flight, and the slaughter of their own men, thought nothing of resisting, and they all now thought that they were surrounded by the cavalry

itaque priusquam telum adigi possit aut nostri propius accederent, omnis Vari acies terga vertit seque in castra recepit|therefore, before the weapon could be driven, or our men could come nearer, the whole line of Varus turned back, and returned to the camp.

Qua in fuga Fabius Paelignus quidam ex infimis ordinibus de exercitu Curionis primum agmen fugientium consecutus magna voce Varum nomine appellans requirebat, uti unus esse ex eius militibus et monere aliquid velle ac dicere videretur|In this flight Fabius Paelignus, one of the lowest ranks of Curio's army, having overtaken the first column of fugitives, calling with a loud voice by the name of Varus, demanded that he should be one of his soldiers, and that he might seem to want to say something and to warn them.

ubi ille saepius appellatus aspexit ac restitit et quis esset aut quid vellet quaesivit, umerum apertum gladio appetit, paulumque afuit quin Varum interficeret; quod ille periculum sublato ad eius conatum scuto vitavit|where he, having been called several times, looked and stopped, and asked who he was or what he wanted, he drew his open shoulder to the sword, and was a little way off from killing Varus; which he avoided by removing the danger from his attempt at the shield

Fabius a proximis militibus circumventus interficitur|Fabius was surrounded by his nearest soldiers and killed

hac fugientium multitudine ac turba portae castrorum occupantur atque iter impeditur, pluresque in eo loco sine vulnere quam in proelio aut fuga intereunt, neque multum afuit quin etiam castris expellerentur, ac nonnulli protinus eodem cursu in oppidum contenderunt|With this multitude of fugitives and multitudes, the gates of the camp were occupied, and the way was obstructed, and many perished in that place without a wound, rather than in battle or in flight;

sed cum loci natura et munitio castrorum aditum prohibebat, tum quod ad proelium egressi Curionis milites iis rebus indigebant quae ad oppugnationem castrorum erant usui|but since the nature of the place and the fortifications prevented access to the camps, and also because the soldiers of Curion, who went out to battle, needed those things which were of use for the assault of the camps

itaque Curio exercitum in castra reducit suis omnibus praeter Fabium incolumibus, ex numero adversariorum circiter dc interfectis ac m vulneratis; qui omnes discessu Curionis multique praeterea per simulationem vulnerum ex castris in oppidum propter timorem sese recipiunt|Curius therefore brought back the army to the camp with all his men unharmed except Fabius, out of the number of his adversaries about 100 slain and 100 wounded. all of whom, on the departure of Curius, and many besides, retreated from the camp into the town, through feigning wounds, through fear

qua re animadversa Varus et terrore exercitus cognito bucinatore in castris et paucis ad speciem tabernaculis relictis de tertia vigilia silentio exercitum in oppidum reducit|Varus having noticed this, and having known the alarm of the army, having left the trumpeter in the camp and a few apparently shelters, on the third watch, silently, brought the army back into the town.

Postero die Curio obsidere Uticam valloque circummunire instituit|On the following day Curio ordered the siege of Utica to be surrounded by a wall

erat in oppido multitudo insolens belli diuturnitate otii, Uticenses pro quibusdam Caesaris in se beneficiis illi amicissimi, conventus is qui ex variis generibus constaret, terror ex superioribus proeliis magnus|there was a multitude in the town, unusual for the length of the war.

itaque de deditione omnes iam palam loquebantur et cum P|therefore all were already openly talking about surrender, and with P

Attio agebant, ne sua pertinacia omnium fortunas perturbari vellet|And so they acted, lest by their obstinacy the fortunes of all should be disturbed

haec cum agerentur, nuntii praemissi ab rege Iuba venerunt, qui illum adesse cum magnis copiis dicerent et de custodia ac defensione urbis hortarentur|While these things were being done, messengers arrived from the king of Juba, who told him that he was present with a large force, and urged him to guard and defend the city.

quae res eorum perterritos animos confirmavit|which fact strengthened their frightened spirits

Nuntiabantur haec eadem Curioni, sed aliquamdiu fides fieri non poterat; tantam habebat sua rum rerum fiduciam|These same things were reported to Curio, but for some time faith could not be made; He had such confidence in his own affairs

iamque Caesaris in Hispania res secundae in Africam nuntiis ac litteris perferebantur|and now Caesar's affairs in Spain were carried to Africa by messengers and letters

quibus omnibus rebus sublatus nihil contra se regem nisurum existimabat|By all these things he thought that the king would make no effort against him

sed ubi certis auctoribus comperit minus v et xx milibus longe ab Utica eius copias abesse, relictis munitionibus sese in Castra Cornelia recepit|but when he learned from certain authorities that his forces were at a distance of less than 50,000 miles from Utica, he left the fortifications and retired to Camp Cornelia

huc frumentum comportare, castra munire, materiam conferre coepit, statimque in Siciliam misit, uti duae legiones reliquusque equitatus ad se mitteretur|he began to bring grain here, to fortify the camp, and to bring material, and immediately sent to Sicily, that two legions and the rest of the cavalry should be sent to him.

castra erant ad bellum ducendum aptissima natura et loci munitione et maris propinquitate et aquae et salis copia, cuius magna vis iam ex proximis erat salinis eo congesta|the camps were very suitable for conducting war, and the fortifications of the place, and the proximity of the sea, and the abundance of water and salt;

non materia multitudine arborum, non frumentum, cuius erant plenissimi agri, deficere poterat|not the material of the multitude of trees, nor the corn, of which the fields were full, could fail

itaque omnium suorum consensu Curio reliquas copias expectare et bellum ducere parabat|therefore, with the consent of all his people, Curius prepared to wait for the rest of the forces and to conduct the war

His constitutis rebus probatisque consiliis ex perfugis quibusdam oppidanis audit Iubam revocatum finitimo bello et controversiis Leptitanorum restitisse in regno et Saburram, eius praefectum, cum mediocribus copiis missum Uticae adpropinquare|After these things had been established and the plans approved, he heard from some fugitives of the townsmen that Juba had been recalled by the neighboring war and disputes of the Leptitans, and had remained in the kingdom, and that Saburra, his governor, had been sent with a moderate force to approach Utica.

his auctoribus temere credens consilium commutat et proelio rem committere constituit|Believing these authorities to be at random, he changes his plan and decides to commit the matter to battle

multum ad hanc rem probandam adiuvat adulescentia, magnitudo animi, superioris temporis proventus, fiducia rei bene gerendae|youth, greatness of mind, previous achievements, and confidence in doing things well help a lot to prove this matter.

his rebus impulsus equitatum omnem prima nocte ad castra hostium mittit ad flumen Bagradam|In consequence of these things he sends the cavalry every first night to the camp of the enemy on the river Bagrada

quibus praeerat Saburra, de quo ante erat auditum, sed rex cum omnibus copiis insequebatur et vi milium passuum intervallo ab Saburra consederat|which was commanded by Saburra, of whom we had heard before;

equites missi nocte iter conficiunt imprudentisque atque inopinantis hostis adgrediuntur|the horsemen being sent make their way by night, and attack the enemy unawares and unexpected

Numidae enim quadam barbara consuetudine nullis ordinibus passim consederant|For the Numidas, by a certain barbarous custom, had settled here and there in no ranks

hos oppressos somno dispersos adorti magnum eorum numerum interficiunt; multi perterriti profugiunt|these oppressed, scattered in their sleep, they slaughtered a great number of them; Many fled in terror

quo facto ad Curionem equites revertuntur captivosque ad eum reducunt|whereupon the horsemen return to Curion, and bring back the prisoners to him

Curio cum omnibus copiis quarta vigilia exierat cohortibus v castris praesidio relictis|Curio, with all his forces, had gone out on the fourth watch, leaving the legions to guard the camp

progressus milia passuum vi equites convenit, rem gestam cognovit; ex captivis quaerit, quis castris ad Bagradam praesit; respondent Saburram|He met with a force of horsemen who had advanced thousands of miles, and knew what had been done; he asks of the prisoners who is in charge of the camp at Bagrada; answered Saburra

reliqua studio itineris conficiendi quaerere praetermittit proximaque respiciens signa, 'videtisne,' inquit 'milites, captivorum orationem cum perfugis convenire? abesse regem, exiguas esse copias missas, quae paucis equitibus pares esse non potuerint? proinde ad praedam, ad gloriam properate, ut iam de praemiis vestris et de referenda gratia cogitare incipiamus|The rest, in the interest of completing the journey, he neglects to seek, and looking at the nearest signs, "do you see," said he, "soldiers, the prayer of the prisoners meeting with the fugitives?" that the king was absent, that the troops sent were small, which could not have been equal to a few horsemen? therefore hasten to the spoil, to the glory, that we may now begin to think of your rewards and of the grace to be reported

' ' erant per se magna quae gesserant equites, praesertim cum eorum exiguus numerus cum tanta multitudine Numidarum conferretur|The things which the horsemen had done were great in themselves, especially when their small number was compared with the great multitude of the Numidians.

haec tamen ab ipsis inflatius commemorabantur, ut de suis homines laudibus libenter praedicant|yet these things were more inflatedly mentioned by them, that their men gladly preached their praises

multa praeterea spolia praeferebantur, capti homines equitesque producebantur, ut quidquid intercederet temporis, hoc omne victoriam morari videretur|besides, many spoils were preferred, men were taken prisoners, and horsemen were produced, so that whatever time intervened, this seemed to delay all victory.

ita spei Curionis militum studia non deerant|thus the hopes of Curio's soldiers were not wanting

equites sequi iubet sese iterque accelerat, ut quam maxime ex fuga perterritos adoriri posset|he orders the horsemen to follow him, and hastens again, that he may be worshiped as much as possible by those who are frightened by flight

at illi itinere totius noctis confecti subsequi non poterant atque alii alio loco resistebant|but they were unable to follow them, having made a whole night's journey, and the others resisted in another place

ne haec quidem res Curionem ad spem morabatur|not even this matter made Curio wait for hope

Iuba certior factus a Saburra de nocturno proelio ii milia Hispanorum et Gallorum equitum, quos suae custodiae causa circum se habere consuerat, et peditum eam partem, cui maxime confidebat, Saburrae summittit; ipse cum reliquis copiis elephantisque lx lentius subsequitur|When Juba was informed by Saburra of the night's battle, he surrendered to Saburra the thousands of Spanish and French cavalry, whom he was accustomed to have around him for the purpose of his guard, and that part of the infantry, in which he trusted the most; He, with the rest of the troops and 60 elephants, followed more slowly

suspicatus praemissis equitibus ipsum adfore Curionem Saburra copias equitum peditumque instruit atque his imperat, ut simulatione timoris paulatim cedant ac pedem referant; sese, cum opus esset, signum proelii daturum et quod rem postulare cognovisset imperaturum|Suspecting that Curion himself would attack the cavalry in advance, Saburra marshaled the troops of horse and foot, and ordered them to give way little by little under the pretense of fear, and return to their feet; when it was necessary, he would give the signal for battle, and would give orders as he knew the matter required

Curio ad superiorem spem addita praesentis temporis opinione hostes fugere arbitratus copias ex locis superioribus in campum deducit|Curius, adding to his higher hopes, and thinking that the enemy were fleeing at the present time, brought his troops from the higher places into the field.

Quibus ex locis cum longius esset progressus, confecto iam labore exercitu xvi milium spatio constitit|From these places, when he had advanced further, the army having finished its work, halted at a distance of sixteen miles

dat suis signum Saburra, aciem constituit et circumire ordines atque hortari incipit|Saburra gives the signal to his men, forms a line, and begins to go round the ranks and to exhort him

sed peditatu dumtaxat procul ad speciem utitur, equites in aciem inmittit|but while he uses the infantry at a distance for appearance, he sends the cavalry into battle

non deest negotio Curio suosque hortatur, ut spem omnem in virtute reponant|There is no lack of business for the Curia, and he exhorts his subjects to place all their hope in virtue

ne militibus quidem, ut defessis, neque equitibus, ut paucis et labore confectis, studium ad pugnandum virtusque deerat; sed hi erant numero cc, reliqui in itinere substiterant|neither the soldiers, as they were tired, nor the horsemen, as they were few and worn out, lacked enthusiasm for fighting and courage; but these were 200 in number, the rest had stopped on the way

hi quamcumque in partem impetum fecerant, hostes loco cedere cogebant, sed neque longius fugientes prosequi, nec vehementius equos incitare poterant|in whatever direction they made an attack, they compelled the enemy to give way, but they could neither pursue them, fleeing farther, nor encourage their horses more violently.

at equitatus hostium ab utroque cornu circumire aciem nostram et aversos proterere incipit|but the enemy's cavalry began to surround our line from both wings, and to drive out the enemy

cum cohortes ex acie procucurrissent, Numidae integri celeritate impetum nostrorum effugiebant, rursusque ad ordines suos se recipientes circumibant et ab acie excludebant|when the cohorts had run out of the line, the Numidians fled with all speed from our attack, and, taking themselves back to their ranks, surrounded them and cut them off from the line.

sic neque in loco manere ordinesque servare, neque procurrere et casum subire tutum videbatur|so that it seemed safe neither to remain in place and to keep the ranks, nor to rush forward and suffer an accident

hostium copiae submissis ab rege auxiliis crebro augebantur; nostros vires lassitudine deficiebant, simul ii qui vulnera acceperant, neque acie excedere, neque in locum tutum referri poterant, quod tota acies equitatu hostium circumdata tenebatur|The forces of the enemy, subdued by the help of the king, were frequently increased; our strength failed with fatigue, and at the same time those who had received wounds could neither leave the line nor be brought back to a place of safety, for the whole line was surrounded by the enemy's cavalry

hi de sua salute desperantes, ut extremo vitae tempore homines facere consuerunt, aut suam mortem miserabantur aut parentes suos commendabant, siquos ex eo periculo fortuna servare potuisset|these, despairing of their safety, as men are wont to do at the end of their lives, either pitied their own death, or commended their parents;

plena erant omnia timoris et luctus|all were full of fear and sorrow

Curio ubi perterritis omnibus neque cohortationes suas neque preces audiri intellegit, unam ut in miseris rebus spem reliquam salutis esse arbitratus proximos colles capere universos atque eo signa inferri iubet|Curius, when all were terrified, and perceiving that neither his encouragement nor his prayers were heard, thought that there was still some hope of salvation in such wretched things, he ordered the whole of the neighboring hills to be taken, and that signs should be brought to him.

hos quoque praeoccupat missus a Saburra equitatus|the cavalry sent by Saburra overtook these also

tum vero ad summam desperationem nostri perveniunt et partim fugientes ab equitatu interficiuntur, partim integri procumbunt|but then they reached the utmost despair of ours, and partly fleeing were killed by the cavalry, partly prostrated unharmed

hortatur Curionem Cn|Cn. urges Curio

Domitius praefectus equitum, cum paucis equitibus circumsistens, ut fuga salutem petat atque in castra contendat, et se ab eo non discessurum pollicetur|Domitius, the commander of the cavalry, standing around with a few horsemen, asked for safety in flight and marched into the camp, and promised not to depart from him.

at Curio numquam se amisso exercitu, quem a Caesare fidei commissum acceperit, in eius conspectum reversurum confirmat atque ita proelians interficitur|but Curius, having never lost himself in the army, which he had received as a pledge of faith from Caesar, affirmed that he would return to his sight, and thus fighting was slain

equites ex proelio perpauci se recipiunt; sed ii quos ad novissimum agmen equorum reficiendorum causa substitisse demonstratum est, fuga totius exercitus procul animadversa sese incolumes in castra conferunt|very few horsemen recover from the battle; but those who were shown to have halted for the purpose of repairing the horses to the last train, having observed the flight of the whole army at a distance, brought themselves unharmed into the camp

milites ad unum omnes interficiuntur|the soldiers are all killed one by one

His rebus cognitis Marcius Rufus quaestor in castris relictus a Curione cohortatur suos, ne animo deficiant|Having learned these things, the procurator Marcus Rufus, left by Curio in the camp, encourages his men not to lose heart

illi orant atque obsecrant, ut in Siciliam navibus reportentur|they pray and entreat that they may be taken by ship to Sicily
