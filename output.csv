Litteris a Fabio  Caesaris consulibus redditis aegre ab his impetratum est summa tribunorum plebis contentione ut in senatu recitarentur|The letters delivered by Fabius Caesar to the consuls were obtained by them with great difficulty, by the greatest contention of the tribunes of the people, to be read in the senate

ut vero ex litteris ad senatum referretur, impetrari non potuit|indeed, it could not be obtained from the letters to the senate

referunt consules de re publica infinite|The consuls report endlessly about the state

Lentulus consul senatu rei publicae se non defuturum pollicetur, si audacter ac fortiter sententias dicere velint|Lentulus, the consul, promised the senate of the republic that he would not fail, if they would speak boldly and boldly.

sin Caesarem respiciant atque eius gratiam sequantur, ut superioribus fecerint temporibus, se sibi consilium capturum neque senatus auctoritati obtemperaturum|unless they respect Caesar and follow his grace, as they did in former times, they will take counsel for themselves, nor submit to the authority of the senate

habere se quoque ad Caesaris gratiam atque amicitiam receptum|to have himself also received into the favor and friendship of Caesar

in eandem sententiam loquitur Scipio: Pompeio esse in animo rei publicae non deesse, si senatus sequatur|Scipio speaks in the same opinion: that Pompey was in mind that there would be no want of public affairs, if the senate followed

si cunctetur atque agat lenius, nequiquam eius auxilium, si postea velit, senatum imploraturum|if he be rebuked and act milder, there is no need for him to implore the help of the senate, if he wishes afterwards

Haec Scipionis oratio, quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque aberat, ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur|This speech of Scipio, that the senate was held in the city and Pompey was absent, seemed to have been sent from the mouth of Pompey himself

dixerat aliquis leniorem sententiam, ut primo  Marcellus, ingressus in eam orationem, non oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri, quam dilectus tota Italia habiti et exercitus conscripti essent, quo praesidio tuto et libere senatus quae vellet decernere auderet|Someone had said a milder opinion, that when Marcellus first entered into that speech, it was not necessary to refer the matter to the senate first, since all Italy had been chosen and the army had been drafted, under which protection the senate could safely and freely decide what it wanted.

ut  Calidius, qui censebat, ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficisceretur, ne qua esset armorum causa|as Calydius, who thought that Pompey should march into his provinces, lest there should be any cause for arms

timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus, ne ad eius periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur|to fear Caesar, having seized two legions from him, lest Pompey should be seen to reserve and detain them to the city for his danger

ut  Rufus, qui sententiam Calidi paucis fere mutatis verbis sequebatur|as Rufus, who followed the opinion of Calidis with almost a few changed words

hi omnes convicio  Lentuli consulis correpti exagitabantur|All these were agitated by the abuse of the consuls of Lentulus

Lentulus sententiam Calidi pronuntiaturum se omnino negavit, Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia discessit|Lentulus absolutely denied that he would pronounce the opinion of Calidis, but Marcellus, terrified by the convictions, withdrew from his opinion

sic vocibus consulis, terrore praesentis exercitus, minis amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis sententiam sequuntur: uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat|thus, by the voices of the consuls, by the terror of the present army, and by the threats of the friends of Pompey, most of them, unwillingly and forcibly compelled to follow the opinion of Scipio, that before a certain day Caesar should dismiss the army

si non faciat, eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri|if he did not do it, it would seem that he would do it against the public interest

intercedit  Antonius  Cassius tribuni plebis|Antonius Cassius, tribune of the people, intervenes

refertur confestim de intercessione tribunorum|It is immediately reported about the intercession of the tribunes

dicuntur sententiae graves|they are called serious sentences

ut quisque acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit, ita quam maxime ab inimicis Caesaris collaudatur|as each one said most bitterly and cruelly, so that he should be applauded as much as possible by Caesar's enemies

Misso ad vesperum senatu omnes, qui sunt eius ordinis, a Pompeio evocantur|Pompey sent to the senate in the evening and summoned all who belonged to his order

laudat promptos atque in posterum confirmat, segniores castigat atque incitat|he praises the ready and strengthens them in the future, chastises and encourages the lazy

multi undique ex veteribus Pompei exercitibus spe praemiorum atque ordinum evocantur, multi ex duabus legionibus, quae sunt traditae a Caesare, arcessuntur|many from the old armies of Pompey are summoned from all quarters in the hope of prizes and orders;

conpletur urbs et ipsum comitium tribunis, centurionibus, evocatis|the city and the assembly itself were filled with tribunes and centurions, who had been summoned

omnes amici consulum, necessarii Pompei atque ii, qui veteres inimicitias cum Caesare gerebant, in senatum coguntur|all the consul's friends, Pompey's necessaries, and those who carried on old enmities with Caesar, were forced into the senate

quorum vocibus et concursu terrentur infirmiores, dubii confirmantur, plerisque vero libere decernendi potestas eripitur|by whose voices and concurrence the weaker are frightened, doubts are confirmed, but the power of free decision is taken away from the majority

pollicetur  Piso censor sese iturum ad Caesarem, item  Roscius praetor, qui de his rebus eum doceant|Piso the censor promises that he will go to Caesar, and also Roscius the praetor, that they may teach him about these matters

sex dies ad eam rem conficiendam spatii postulant|They require six days' space to complete the matter

dicuntur etiam ab nonnullis sententiae, ut legati ad Caesarem mittantur, qui voluntatem senatus ei proponant|Some also say that ambassadors should be sent to Caesar to present to him the will of the senate

Omnibus his resistitur omnibusque oratio consulis, Scipionis, Catonis opponitur|All these are resisted, and all the speeches of the consuls, of Scipio, of Cato, are opposed

Catonem veteres inimicitiae Caesaris incitant et dolor repulsae|Cato was stirred up by Caesar's old enmity, and by the grief of being repulsed

Lentulus aeris alieni magnitudine et spe exercitus ac provinciarum et regum appellandorum largitionibus movetur, seque alterum fore Sullam inter suos gloriatur, ad quem summa imperii redeat|Lentulus, moved by the greatness of the foreign air, and by the hope of the army, and of the bounty of the provinces and of the calling kings, followed him and boasted that Sulla would be the second among his people, to whom the sum of the empire should return.

Scipionem eadem spes provinciae atque exercituum impellit, quos se pro necessitudine partiturum cum Pompeio arbitratur, simul iudiciorum metus atque ostentatio sui et adulatio potentium, qui in re publica iudiciisque tum plurimum pollebant|Scipio was impelled by the same hope of the province and the armies, whom he thought he would win for his alliance with Pompey, and at the same time the fear of judgments, and the display of himself, and the flattery of the powerful, who at the same time exerted a great deal of influence in the affairs of the state and the judgments.

ipse Pompeius ab inimicis Caesaris incitatus, et quod neminem dignitate secum exaequari volebat, totum se ab eius amicitia averterat et cum communibus inimicis in gratiam redierat, quorum ipse maximam partem illo adfinitatis tempore iniunxerat Caesari|Pompey himself, incited by Caesar's enemies, and wishing no one to equal him in dignity, had turned himself entirely away from his friendship, and had returned to favor with his common enemies, of whom he had at that time enjoined the greatest part of his affinity with Caesar

simul infamia duarum legionum permotus, quas ab itinere Asiae Syriaeque ad suam potentiam dominatumque converterat, rem ad arma deduci studebat|At the same time, moved by the infamy of the two legions, which he had converted from the journey of Asia and Syria to his power and dominion, he endeavored to bring the matter to arms.

His de causis aguntur omnia raptim atque turbate|For these reasons everything is done with haste and confusion

nec docendi Caesaris propinquis eius spatium datur, nec tribunis plebis sui periculi deprecandi neque etiam extremi iuris intercessione retinendi, quod  Sulla reliquerat, facultas tribuitur, sed de sua salute septimo die cogitare coguntur, quod illi turbulentissimi superioribus temporibus tribuni plebis post octo denique menses variarum actionum respicere ac timere †consuerant|Caesar's relatives are not given space to teach him, nor are the tribunes of the people given the opportunity to plead for their danger, nor even with the last intercession of the law, which Sulla had left, is given the opportunity, but they are forced to think about their own safety on the seventh day, because those most turbulent former times of the tribunes of the people after eight months of various actions they were accustomed to look back and fear

† decurritur ad illud extremum atque ultimum senatus consultum, quo nisi paene in ipso urbis incendio atque in desperatione omnium salutis latorum audacia numquam ante descensum est: dent operam consules, praetores, tribuni plebis, quique pro consulibus sunt ad urbem, nequid res publica detrimenti capiat|† He ran to that last and last council of the senate, in which the boldness of all sides had never before descended except almost in the very burning of the city, and in the despair of all sides of salvation: let the consuls, praetors, tribunes of the people, and those who are for the consuls go to the city, take care that the public affairs should not suffer loss

Proximis diebus habetur extra urbem senatus|In the next few days the senate is held outside the city

Pompeius eadem illa, quae per Scipionem ostenderat, agit, senatus virtutem constantiamque collaudat, copias suas exponit: legiones habere sese paratas x|Pompey does the same things which he had shown through Scipio;

praeterea cognitum compertumque sibi alieno esse animo in Caesarem milites, neque iis posse persuaderi, uti eum defendant aut sequantur|moreover, it was known and discovered that the soldiers were of a foreign mind to Caesar, and that they could not be persuaded to defend or follow him

consules, †quod ante id tempus accidit nunquam, ex urbe proficiscuntur, lictoresque habent in urbe et Capitolio privati contra omnia vetustatis exempla†|The consuls, †which had never happened before that time, set out from the city, and had private licitors in the city and the Capitol, contrary to all precedents.

Caesarem quoque pro sua dignitate debere et studium et iracundiam suam rei publicae dimittere neque adeo graviter irasci inimicis, ut cum illis nocere se speret, rei publicae noceat|Caesar, too, for his own dignity, ought to let go of his zeal and anger for the cause of the state, and not to be so gravely angry with his enemies, as to hope to harm himself with them, to harm the state.

quonam haec omnia nisi ad suam perniciem pertinere? sed tamen ad omnia se descendere paratum atque omnia pati rei publicae causa|How can all this be except to his own destruction? but, nevertheless, he was ready to descend to everything, and to suffer everything for the cause of the state

Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar, etsi magni interesse arbitrabatur quam primum oppido potiri cohortesque ad se in castra traducere, nequa aut largitionibus aut animi confirmatione aut falsis nuntiis commutatio fieret voluntatis, quod saepe in bello parvis momentis magni casus intercederent, tamen veritus ne militum introitu et nocturni temporis licentia oppidum diriperetur, eos qui venerant collaudat atque in oppidum dimittit, portas murosque adservari iubet|When Caesar learned of these things, although he thought that it was of great interest to take possession of the town as soon as possible, and to transfer the cohorts to his camp, lest there should be a change of will either by bribes, or by persuasion of mind, or by false reports; at the leave of time the town was sacked, he applauded those who had come and sent them into the town, ordering the gates and walls to be guarded

cuius orationem Caesar interpellat: se non maleficii causa ex provincia egressum, sed uti se a contumeliis inimicorum defenderet, ut tribunos plebis in ea re ex civitate expulsos in suam dignitatem restitueret, et se et populum Romanum factione paucorum oppressum in libertatem vindicaret|whose speech Caesar interrupts, saying that he had not come out of the province because of evil, but to defend himself from the insults of his enemies, to restore the tribunes of the people, who had been expelled from the city in that matter, to their dignity, and to vindicate himself and the Roman people, oppressed by the faction of a few, into liberty

milites positis scalis muros ascendunt, sed moniti a Brundisinis, ut vallum caecum fossasque caveant, subsistunt et longo itinere ab his circumducti ad portum perveniunt duasque naves cum militibus, quae ad moles Caesaris adhaeserant, scaphis lintribusque reprehendunt, reprehensas excipiunt|The soldiers placed ladders and ascended the walls, but being warned by the Brundisini to beware of the blind wall and ditches, they halted, and being escorted by them by a long journey, they reached the port, and the two ships with the soldiers, which had stuck to Caesar's mass, rebuked the ships and boats, and received the rebuked

Caesar etsi ad spem conficiendi negoti maxime probabat coactis navibus mare transire et Pompeium sequi, priusquam ille sese transmarinis auxiliis confirmaret, tamen eius rei moram temporisque longinquitatem timebat, quod omnibus coactis navibus Pompeius praesentem facultatem insequendi sui ademerat|Although Caesar, in the hope of accomplishing the business, most decided to cross the sea with forced ships and follow Pompey, before he had strengthened himself with overseas aid, yet he feared the delay of time and the remoteness of the matter, because by all the forced ships Pompey had deprived him of the present opportunity of following him.

relinquebatur, ut ex longinquioribus regionibus Galliae Picenique et a freto naves essent exspectandae|it was left, so that ships from the more distant regions of Gaul, Picenique, and from the strait, were to be awaited

Itaque in praesentia Pompei sequendi rationem omittit, in Hispaniam proficisci constituit, duumviris municipiorum omnium imperat, ut naves conquirant Brundisiumque deducendas curent|Therefore, in the presence of Pompey, he abandons the idea of following him, resolves to set out for Spain, and orders the duumvirs of all the municipalities to seize the ships and take care to bring them to Brundisius.

commisso ab equitibus proelio signa legionum duarum procul ab utrisque conspiciuntur, quas  Fabius ulteriore ponte subsidio nostris miserat, suspicatus fore, id quod accidit, ut duces adversariorum occasione et beneficio fortunae ad nostros opprimendos uterentur|and when the cavalry had engaged in battle, the signs of the two legions were seen at a distance on either side, which Fabius had sent to our relief by a further bridge;

potestate facta Afranius copias educit et in medio colle sub castris constituit|Afranius, having gained power, led out his troops and encamped in the middle of the hill

Caesar ubi cognovit per Afranium stare, quominus proelio dimicaretur, ab infimis radicibus montis intermissis circiter passibus cccc castra facere constituit, et, ne in opere faciundo milites repentino hostium incursu exterrerentur atque opere prohiberentur, vallo muniri vetuit, quod eminere et procul videri necesse erat, sed a fronte contra hostem pedum xv fossam fieri iussit|Caesar, when he learned that Afranium was standing by, so that he could not engage in a battle, decided to make a camp about 300 yards from the lowest roots of the mountain, and, lest the soldiers in doing the work should be frightened by the sudden attack of the enemy and be prevented from working, he forbade to be fortified with a rampart, which must have stood out and could be seen from a distance. but he ordered a ditch to be made fifteen feet from the front against the enemy

et prima et secunda acies in armis, ut ab initio constituta erat, permanebat|and the first and second line continued in arms, as it had been constituted from the beginning

sub vesperum Caesar intra hanc fossam legiones reducit atque ibi sub armis proxima nocte conquiescit|in the evening Caesar withdraws his legions into this trench, and rests there under arms the next night

Postero die omnem exercitum intra fossam continet, et, quod longius erat agger petendus, in praesentia similem rationem operis instituit, singulaque latera castrorum singulis attribuit legionibus munienda, fossasque ad eandem magnitudinem perfici iubet|The next day he contained the whole army within a ditch, and, as the mound was farther to be sought, he instituted a similar plan of work for the present, and assigned each side of the camp to be fortified by legions, and ordered the ditches to be completed to the same size.

reliquas legiones in armis expeditas contra hostem constituit|He set the rest of the legions ready in arms against the enemy

Afranius Petreiusque terrendi causa atque operis impediendi copias suas ad infimas montis radices producunt et proelio lacessunt|Afranius and Petreius, in order to frighten them, and to hinder the work, brought forth their forces to the lowest foot of the mountain, and engaged in battle.

neque idcirco Caesar opus intermittit confisus praesidio legionum trium et munitione fossae|nor therefore did Caesar interrupt the work, trusting to the protection of three legions and the fortification of the ditch

illi non diu commorati nec longius ab infimo colle progressi copias in castra reducunt|they did not stay long, nor had they advanced further from the lowest hill, they returned the troops to the camp

tertio die Caesar vallo castra communit, reliquas cohortes, quas in superioribus castris reliquerat, impedimentaque ad se traduci iubet|On the third day Caesar marched the camp to the ramparts, and ordered the remaining cohorts, which he had left in the earlier camps, and the baggage to be brought to him.

quem si occupavisset Caesar et communivisset, ab oppido et ponte et commeatu omni, quem in oppidum contulerant, se interclusurum adversarios confidebat|which, if Caesar had taken possession of it and communicated it, he was confident that he would cut off his adversaries from the town and the bridge and all the provisions which they had brought into the town

hoc sperans legiones iii ex castris educit acieque in locis idoneis structa unius legionis antesignanos procurrere atque eum tumulum occupare iubet|hoping for this, he led out the 3rd legions from the camp, and, forming a line in suitable places, ordered the vanguard of one of the legions to advance, and order him to occupy the mound

qua re cognita celeriter, quae in statione pro castris erant Afrani cohortes, breviore itinere ad eundem occupandum locum mittuntur|which matter being speedily learned, the cohorts of Afran, who were in station for the camp, are sent by a shorter journey to occupy the same place

contenditur proelio, et, quod prius in tumulum Afraniani venerant, nostri repelluntur atque aliis submissis subsidiis terga vertere seque ad signa legionum recipere coguntur|the battle was fought, and, as the Afranians had first come to the mound, our men were repulsed, and being forced to turn their backs, with the help of other submissives, and to receive the standards of the legions

Genus erat pugnae militum illorum, ut magno impetu primo procurrerent, audacter locum caperent, ordines suos non magno opere servarent, rari dispersique pugnarent, si premerentur, pedem referre et loco excedere non turpe existimarent, cum Lusitanis reliquisque barbaris|It was the manner of their soldiers to fight, that they should advance with a great charge at the first, boldly take their place, keep their ranks with no great effort, and fight sparsely and scattered;

genere quodam pugnae assuefacti|accustomed to a certain kind of battle

quod fere fit, quibus quisque in locis miles inveteraverit, ut multum earum regionum consuetudine moveatur|which generally happens, in which places each soldier has grown old, so that a great deal of those regions are moved by habit

haec tum ratio nostros perturbavit insuetos huius generis pugnae|and this reason disturbed our minds, unaccustomed to this kind of combat

circumiri enim sese ab aperto latere procurrentibus singulis arbitrabantur|for they thought that they should be surrounded by each one running from the open side

ipsi autem suos ordines servare neque ab signis discedere neque sine gravi causa eum locum, quem ceperant, dimitti censuerant oportere|but they themselves considered it necessary to keep their lines, neither to depart from their standards, nor to leave the place they had taken without serious cause.

itaque perturbatis antesignanis legio, quae in eo cornu constiterat, locum non tenuit atque in proximum collem sese recepit|therefore, the legion of the fore-sign, which had been stationed in that horn, being disturbed, did not hold their ground, and retreated to the next hill

Caesar paene omni acie perterrita, quod praeter opinionem consuetudinemque acciderat, cohortatus suos legionem nonam subsidio ducit|Caesar, terrified on almost every front, which had happened contrary to belief and custom, encouraged his men and led the ninth legion to the relief.

hostem insolenter atque acriter nostros insequentem supprimit rursusque terga vertere seque ad oppidum Ilerdam recipere et sub muro consistere cogit|He suppresses the enemy pursuing us with impudence and fierceness;

sed nonae legionis milites elati studio, dum sarcire acceptum detrimentum volunt, temere insecuti longius fugientis in locum iniquum progrediuntur et sub montem, in quo erat oppidum positum Ilerda, succedunt|but the soldiers of the ninth legion, with great zeal, while they wished to repair the loss they had received, pursued the fugitive at random, advanced further into an unfair place, and succeeded under the mountain on which the town of Ilerda was situated.

hinc se recipere cum vellent, rursus illi ex loco superiore nostros premebant|When they wanted to retreat from here, they again pressed ours from a higher place

praeruptus locus erat utraque ex parte derectus, ac tantum in latitudinem patebat, ut tres instructae cohortes eum locum explerent, ut neque subsidia a lateribus submitti neque equites laborantibus usui esse possent|there was a precipitous place on each side, and it was open enough in breadth, that three regiments should fill that place, so that neither support could be sent down from the sides, nor could the cavalry be of use to the laborers.

ab oppido autem declivis locus tenui fastigio vergebat in longitudinem passus circiter cccc|and from the town a sloping place extended by a thin summit, about 300 miles in length

hac nostris erat receptus, quod eo incitati studio inconsultius processerant|This was the retreat of our men, who had proceeded more imprudently in their eagerness

hoc pugnabatur loco et propter angustias iniquo, et quod sub ipsis radicibus montis constiterant, ut nullum frustra telum in eos mitteretur|This was fought in an unfair place and because of the difficulties, and because they were stationed under the very roots of the mountain, so that no weapon could be thrown against them in vain.

tamen virtute et patientia nitebantur atque omnia vulnera sustinebant|yet they persisted in strength and patience, and endured all wounds

augebantur illis copiae, atque ex castris cohortes per oppidum crebro submittebantur, ut integri defessis succederent|their forces were increased, and cohorts from the camp were frequently sent through the town, so that they might succeed in being exhausted and exhausted

hoc idem Caesar facere cogebatur, ut submissis in eundem locum cohortibus defessos reciperet|Caesar was forced to do the same thing, in order to receive the tired cohorts by sending them to the same place

Hoc cum esset modo pugnatum continenter horis quinque nostrique gravius a multitudine premerentur, consumptis omnibus telis gladiis destrictis impetum adversus montem in cohortis faciunt, paucisque deiectis reliquos sese convertere cogunt|When this had just been fought continuously for five hours, our men were more severely pressed by the multitude, and, having consumed all their weapons and stripped them of their swords, they made an attack against the mountain in a cohort, and after a few fell, forced the rest to turn back.

submotis sub murum cohortibus ac nonnulla parte propter terrorem in oppidum compulsis facilis est nostris receptus datus|the troops being moved under the wall, and some parts driven into the town by reason of terror, it was easy for us to retreat

equitatus autem noster ab utroque latere, etsi deiectis atque inferioribus locis constiterat, tamen summa in iugum virtute conititur, atque inter duas acies perequitans commodiorem ac tutiorem nostris receptum dat|and our cavalry on both sides, although they had halted in low and low places, yet they were driven together with the utmost vigor, and riding between the two lines gave us a more comfortable and safe retreat.

ita vario certamine pugnatum est|and thus a varied struggle was fought

nostri in primo congressu circiter lxx ceciderunt, in his  Fulginius ex primo hastato legionis xiiii, qui propter eximiam virtutem ex inferioribus ordinibus in eum locum pervenerat|In the first encounter about 70 of our men fell, among them Fulginius from the first lance of the 13th legion, who had reached that place from the lower ranks because of his exceptional bravery.

vulnerantur amplius dc|they are wounded more than

ex Afranianis interficiuntur  Caecilius, primi pili centurio, et praeter eum centuriones iiii, milites amplius cc|Caecilius, the first centurion of the Afranians, and besides him 33 centurions, more than 100 soldiers, are killed

Sed haec eius diei praefertur opinio, ut se utrique superiores discessisse existimarent: Afraniani, quod cum esse omnium iudicio inferiores viderentur, comminus tamdiu stetissent et nostrorum impetum sustinuissent et initio locum tumulumque tenuissent, quae causa pugnandi fuerat, et nostros primo congressu terga vertere coegissent|But this is the preferred opinion of that day, that they thought they were superior to both: that the Afranians, though they were seen by all to be inferior, had stood so long at close quarters, and had withstood our attack, and at the beginning had held the place and the mound, which had been the cause of the fight, and forced ours to turn their backs at the first encounter.

nostri autem, quod iniquo loco atque impari congressi numero quinque horis proelium sustinuissent, quod montem gladiis destrictis ascendissent, quod ex loco superiore terga vertere adversarios coegissent atque in oppidum compulissent|but ours, that having met in an unfair place and in an unequal number, they had sustained the battle for five hours, that they had ascended the mountain with their swords drawn, that they had forced their adversaries to turn their backs from a higher place, and had driven them into the town

illi eum tumulum, pro quo pugnatum est, magnis operibus muniverunt praesidiumque ibi posuerunt|they fortified that mound, for which it was fought, with great works, and placed a garrison there

Accidit etiam repentinum incommodum biduo, quo haec gesta sunt|A sudden inconvenience also happened in the two days in which these things were done

tanta enim tempestas cooritur, ut numquam illis locis maiores aquas fuisse constaret|for the storm was raging so much that it was evident that there had never been greater water in those places

tum autem ex omnibus montibus nives proluit ac summas ripas fluminis superavit pontisque ambos, quos  Fabius fecerat, uno die interrupit|and then the snow poured down from all the mountains, and overcame the highest banks of the river, and in one day broke both the bridges which Fabius had made.

quae res magnas difficultates exercitui Caesaris attulit|which event brought great difficulties to Caesar's army

castra enim, ut supra demonstratum est, cum essent inter flumina duo, Sicorim et Cingam, spatio milium xxx, neutrum horum transiri poterat, necessarioque omnes his angustiis continebantur|for the camp, as has been pointed out above, being between the two rivers, the Sicorim and the Cingum, a distance of 30 miles, neither of these could be crossed, and necessarily all were contained by these narrows

neque civitates, quae ad Caesaris amicitiam accesserant, frumentum supportare neque ii, qui pabulatum longius progressi erant, interclusi fluminibus reverti neque maximi commeatus, qui ex Italia Galliaque veniebant, in castra pervenire poterant|neither the states which had come to the friendship of Caesar, could support the grain, nor those who had advanced further for forage, were prevented from returning by the rivers, nor could the great supplies which came from Italy and Gaul reach the camp

tempus erat autem difficillimum, quo neque frumenta in cavernis erant, neque multum a maturitate aberant, ac civitates exinanitae, quod Afranius paene omne frumentum ante Caesaris adventum Ilerdam convexerat, reliqui siquid fuerat, Caesar superioribus diebus consumpserat|but it was a very difficult time, when there was no corn in the cellars, nor much of it far from being ripe, and the cities being emptied, because Afranius had boiled almost all the corn before Caesar's arrival at Ilerda, and the rest whatever had been, Caesar had consumed in the preceding days

pecora, quod secundum poterat esse inope re subsidium, propter bellum finitimae civitates longius removerant|the cattle, which might have been a second source of support for the poor, had, on account of the war, removed the neighboring states to a greater distance

qui erant pabulandi aut frumentandi causa progressi, hos levis armaturae Lusitani peritique earum regionum caetrati citerioris Hispaniae consectabantur|who had advanced for the purpose of foraging or raising grain, these were pursued by the light troops of the Lusitanians and the skirmishers of those regions of the rest of Spain

quibus erat proclive tranare flumen, quod consuetudo eorum omnium est, ut sine utribus ad exercitum non eant|to whom it was inclined to cross the river, which is the custom of all of them, so that they would not go to the army without bottles

At exercitus Afrani omnium rerum abundabat copia|But Afran's army was abundant in all things

multum erat frumentum provisum et convectum superioribus temporibus, multum ex omni provincia comportabatur|a great deal of grain was provided and transported in former times, and much of it was brought from every province

magna copia pabuli suppetebat|There was plenty of fodder available

harum omnium rerum facultates sine ullo periculo pons Ilerdae praebebat et loca trans flumen integra, quo omnino Caesar adire non poterat|The bridge of Ilerda afforded the means of all these things without any danger, and the places on the other side of the river were intact, to which Caesar could not go at all.

Hae permanserunt aquae dies complures|These waters continued for several days

conatus est Caesar reficere pontes, sed nec magnitudo fluminis permittebat, neque ad ripam dispositae cohortes adversariorum perfici patiebantur|Caesar endeavored to repair the bridges, but the greatness of the river did not allow it, nor could the troops of the adversaries, arranged on the bank, be finished

quod illis prohibere erat facile cum ipsius fluminis natura atque aquae magnitudine, tum quod ex totis ripis in unum atque angustum locum tela iaciebantur|because it was easy for them to stop them, with the nature of the river itself and the size of the water, and also because the weapons were thrown from all the banks into one and narrow place

atque erat difficile eodem tempore rapidissimo flumine opera perficere et tela vitare|and it was difficult at the same time to accomplish the work in the swiftest river and to avoid the guns

Nuntiatur Afranio magnos commeatus, qui iter habebant ad Caesarem, ad flumen constitisse|It was reported to Afranius that a large supply, which was on its way to Caesar, had halted at the river

venerant eo sagittarii ex Rutenis, equites ex Gallia cum multis carris magnisque impedimentis, ut fert Gallica consuetudo|archers from the Ruthenes, horsemen from Gaul, with many chariots and great baggage, according to the French custom

erant praeterea cuiusque generis hominum milia circiter vi cum servis liberisque|There were also about a thousand men of every kind, with servants and children

sed nullus ordo, nullum imperium certum, cum suo quisque consilio uteretur atque omnes sine timore iter facerent usi superiorum temporum atque itinerum licentia|but there was no order, no definite government, with each one using his own counsel, and all traveling without fear, using the permission of former times and journeys

erant complures honesti adulescentes, senatorum filii et ordinis equestris|there were several honorable young men, the sons of senators and of the knightly order

erant legationes civitatum, erant legati Caesaris|they were the embassies of the states, they were the ambassadors of Caesar

hos omnis flumina continebant|all the rivers contained these

ad hos opprimendos cum omni equitatu tribusque legionibus Afranius de nocte proficiscitur inprudentisque ante missis equitibus adgreditur|In order to crush these, Afranius set out by night with all the cavalry and three legions.

celeriter sese tamen Galli equites expediunt proeliumque committunt|The Gauls, however, quickly prepared their horsemen and began the battle

ii dum pari certamine res geri potuit, magnum hostium numerum pauci sustinuere|while the matter could have been carried on with equal combat, few could support a great number of the enemy

sed ubi signa legionum adpropinquare coeperunt, paucis amissis sese in proximos montes conferunt|but when the standards of the legions began to approach, they retreated to the neighboring mountains, losing a few

hoc pugnae tempus magnum attulit nostris ad salutem momentum|This period of battle brought great importance to our safety

nacti enim spatium se in loca superiora receperunt|for having gained space, they received themselves into higher places

desiderati sunt eo die sagittarii circiter cc, equites pauci, calonum atque impedimentorum non magnus numerus|About 200 archers, a few horsemen, and not a great number of chariots and wagons were missing that day

His tamen omnibus annona crevit|However, for all these, the food grew

quae fere res non solum inopia praesenti, sed etiam futuri temporis timore ingravescere consuevit|which matter is usually aggravated not only by the want of the present, but also by the fear of the future

iamque ad denarios l in singulos modios annona pervenerat, et militum vires inopia frumenti deminuerat, atque incommoda in dies augebantur|and now the price had reached 1 pence per bushel, and the strength of the soldiers had been diminished by the want of grain, and the inconveniences were increasing day by day.

et tam paucis diebus magna erat rerum facta commutatio ac se fortuna inclinaverat, ut nostri magna inopia necessariarum rerum conflictarentur, illi omnibus abundarent rebus superioresque haberentur|and in a few days so great an exchange of things had taken place, and fortune had inclined itself, that ours, struggling with a great scarcity of necessaries, were abundant in all things, and had superior things.

Caesar iis civitatibus, quae ad eius amicitiam accesserant, quod minor erat frumenti copia, pecus imperabat|Caesar commanded the cattle of those states which had come to his friendship, because the supply of grain was less

calones ad longinquiores civitates dimittebat|He sent the galleons to the more distant cities

ipse praesentem inopiam, quibus poterat subsidiis, tutabatur|he protected himself from the present want by the resources he could

Haec Afranius Petreiusque et eorum amici pleniora etiam atque uberiora Romam ad suos perscribebant|After this, Afranius and Petreus and their friends wrote to their people that Rome was still fuller and richer

multa rumores adfingebant, ut paene bellum confectum videretur|Many rumors were created, so that it seemed that the war was almost over

quibus litteris nuntiisque Romam perlatis magni domum concursus ad Afranium magnaeque gratulationes fiebant|When these letters and news had been brought to Rome, a great crowd gathered at Afranius's house, and great congratulations were given

multi ex Italia ad Cn|many from Italy to Cn

Pompeium proficiscebantur, alii, ut principes talem nuntium attulisse, alii, ne eventum belli exspectasse aut ex omnibus novissimi venisse viderentur|Pompey set out, some that the princes should bring such news, others that they might not be seen to have waited for the outcome of the war, or to have come last of all.

Cum in his angustiis res esset atque omnes viae ab Afranianis militibus equitibusque obsiderentur nec pontes perfici possent, imperat militibus Caesar ut naves faciant, cuius generis eum superioribus annis usus Britanniae docuerat|When things were in these straits, and all the roads were blocked by the soldiers and horsemen of the Afranians, and the bridges could not be completed, Caesar ordered the soldiers to make ships, of which kind he had taught him in former years the use of Britain.

carinae ac prima statumina ex levi materia fiebant|the keels and the first statins were made of light material

reliquum corpus navium viminibus contextum coriis integebatur|the rest of the ship's body was covered with leather woven with wicker

has perfectas carris iunctis devehit noctu milia passuum a castris xxii militesque his navibus flumen transportat continentemque ripae collem improviso occupat|He drove these perfect chariots together by night 22 miles from the camp, and in these ships he transported the soldiers up the river and seized the hill on the bank of the mainland by surprise.

hunc celeriter, priusquam ab adversariis sentiatur, communit|he shares this quickly, before it is felt by his adversaries

huc legionem postea transicit atque ex utraque parte pontem institutum biduo perficit|He afterwards crossed the legion thither, and in two days completed the bridge on each side

ita commeatus et, qui frumenti causa processerant, tuto ad se recipit et rem frumentariam expedire incipit|thus he safely receives the supplies and those who had gone forth for the corn, and begins to arrange the corn business

Eodem die equitum magnam partem flumen transiecit|On the same day the cavalry crossed a great part of the river

qui inopinantes pabulatores et sine ullo dissipatos timore adgressi magnum numerum iumentorum atque hominum intercipiunt cohortibusque caetratis subsidio missis scienter in duas partes sese distribuunt, alii ut praesidio sint praedae, alii ut venientibus resistant atque eos propellant, unamque cohortem, quae temere ante ceteras extra aciem procurrerat, seclusam ab reliquis circumveniunt atque interficiunt, incolumesque cum magna praeda eodem ponte in castra revertuntur|who, when the foragers were not expecting them, and without any fear of being dispersed, attacked a great number of cattle and men, and, having been sent to the relief of the cavalry, deliberately divided themselves into two parts, some to guard the prey, and others to resist and repel those who came; , secluded from the rest, they surround and kill them, and return unscathed to the camp with a great booty by the same bridge

Dum haec ad Ilerdam geruntur, Massilienses usi  Domiti consilio navis longas expediunt numero xvii, quarum erant xi tectae|While these things were going on at Ilerda, the people of Marseilles, using the advice of Domitius, prepared 17 long ships, of which 11 were decked.

multa huc minora navigia addunt, ut ipsa multitudine nostra classis terreatur|They bring many smaller ships here, so that our fleet is frightened by the sheer number of them

magnum numerum sagittariorum, magnum Albicorum, de quibus supra demonstratum est, inponunt, atque hos praemiis pollicitationibusque incitant|They set up a great number of archers, a great number of Albicians, as has been pointed out above, and incited them with rewards and promises

certas sibi deposcit navis Domitius atque has colonis pastoribusque, quos secum adduxerat, complet|Domitius takes certain ships for himself, and completes them with the colonists and shepherds whom he had brought with him

sic omnibus rebus instructa classe magna fiducia ad nostras navis procedunt, quibus praeerat  Brutus|Thus the fleet, equipped with all things, proceeded with great confidence to our ships, of which Brutus was in command

hae ad insulam, quae est contra Massiliam, stationes obtinebant|these occupied their stations on the island which is opposite Marseilles

Erat multo inferior numero navium Brutus|Brutus was much inferior in number of ships

sed electos ex omnibus legionibus fortissimos viros, antesignanos, centuriones, Caesar ei classi attribuerat, qui sibi id muneris depoposcerant|but Caesar had chosen from all the legions the strongest men, the forerunners, the centurions, and assigned to him the class, who had deposed to him that service

hi manus ferreas atque harpagones paraverant, magnoque numero pilorum, tragularum reliquorumque telorum se instruxerant|these had prepared iron hands and harpoons, and had prepared themselves with a great number of hairs, slings, and the rest of their weapons.

ita cognito hostium adventu suas naves ex portu educunt, cum Massiliensibus confligunt|having thus learned of the approach of the enemy, they brought their ships out of the harbor, and engaged with the Massilians

pugnatum est utrimque fortissime atque acerrime|it was fought on both sides with the greatest strength and zeal

neque multum Albici nostris virtute cedebant, homines asperi et montani et exercitati in armis|Nor did the whites yield much to our strength, men rough and mountainous and trained in arms

atque hi modo digressi a Massiliensibus recentem eorum pollicitationem animis continebant, pastoresque Domiti spe libertatis excitati sub oculis domini suam probare operam studebant|and these having just departed from the Massilians, they kept their recent promise in their hearts, and the shepherds of Domitius, excited by the hope of liberty, endeavored to prove their service under the eyes of their master.

Ipsi Massilienses et celeritate navium et scientia gubernatorum confisi nostros eludebant impetusque eorum excipiebant et, quoad licebat latiore uti spatio, producta longius acie circumvenire nostros aut pluribus navibus adoriri singulas aut remos transcurrentes detergere, si possent, contendebant|The Marseilles themselves, relying on the speed of their ships and the knowledge of their pilots, eluded us and met their attacks, and, as far as it was possible to use a wider space, they endeavored to surround ours in a longer line, or to be worshiped by several ships, and to sweep away each one or the oars passing by, if they could.

cum propius erat necessario ventum, ab scientia gubernatorum atque artificiis ad virtutem montanorum confugiebant|when the wind was necessarily nearer, they took refuge from the knowledge of the pilots and the artifices of the mountaineers

nostri cum minus exercitatis remigibus minusque peritis gubernatoribus utebantur, qui repente ex onerariis navibus erant producti nequedum etiam vocabulis armamentorum cognitis, tum etiam tarditate et gravitate navium impediebantur|ours used less trained crews and less experienced pilots, who had suddenly been produced from cargo ships and did not even know the terms of armament, and were also hindered by the slowness and gravity of the ships

factae enim subito ex umida materia non eundem usum celeritatis habuerant|for they had suddenly been made of moist material and had not had the same use of speed

itaque dum locus comminus pugnandi daretur, aequo animo singulas binis navibus obiciebant atque iniecta manu ferrea et retenta utraque navi diversi pugnabant atque in hostium naves transcendebant et magno numero Albicorum et pastorum interfecto partem navium deprimunt, nonnullas cum hominibus capiunt, reliquas in portum compellunt|therefore, while there was room for close combat, they attacked each one with two ships with an equal spirit, and, throwing in an iron hand and restraining each ship, fought with each different ship, and overtook the enemy's ships, and after slaying a great number of the Albicians and shepherds, sank part of the ships, captured some with the men, and drove the rest into the harbor

eo die naves Massiliensium cum his, quae sunt captae, intereunt viiii|On that day the ships of the Massilians perished with those who had been captured

Hoc cum primum Caesari ad Ilerdam nuntiatur, simul perfecto ponte celeriter fortuna mutatur|When this was first reported to Caesar at Ilerdas, fortune quickly changed with the completion of the bridge

illi perterriti virtute equitum minus libere, minus audacter vagabantur|they, frightened by the prowess of the horse, roamed less freely, less boldly

alias non longo a castris progressi spatio, ut celerem receptum haberent, angustius pabulabantur, alias longiore circuitu custodias stationesque equitum vitabant, aut aliquo accepto detrimento aut procul equitatu viso ex medio itinere proiectis sarcinis refugiebant|at other times, when they did not advance a long distance from the camp, in order to have a speedy retreat, they foraged more narrowly;

postremo et plures intermittere dies et praeter consuetudinem omnium noctu constituerant pabulari|Finally, they decided to take several days off and, contrary to the custom of all, to feed at night

Interim Oscenses et Calagurritani, qui erant cum Oscensibus contributi, mittunt ad eum legatos seseque imperata facturos pollicentur|Meanwhile the Oscens and the Calagurritani, who were allied with the Oscens, sent ambassadors to him, and promised to carry out their orders.

hos Tarraconenses et Iacetani et Ausetani et paucis post diebus Illurgavonenses, qui flumen Hiberum attingunt, insequuntur|the Tarraconians, the Jacetans, and the Ausetans, and a few days later the Illurgavonians, who reach the river Hiberus, pursue them

petit ab his omnibus, ut se frumento iuvent|He asks all these to help themselves with corn

pollicentur atque omnibus undique conquisitis iumentis in castra deportant|they promised and brought back to the camp all the cattle they had taken from all sides

transit etiam cohors Illurgavonensis ad eum cognito civitatis consilio et signa ex statione transfert|the band of Illurgavon also passes over to him, knowing the council of the city, and conveys the signals from the station

magna celeriter commutatio rerum|a great rapid exchange of things

perfecto ponte, magnis quinque civitatibus ad amicitiam adiunctis, expedita re frumentaria, exstinctis rumoribus de auxiliis legionum, quae cum Pompeio per Mauretaniam venire dicebantur, multae longinquiores civitates ab Afranio desciscunt et Caesaris amicitiam sequuntur|the bridge having been completed, the five great states joined to friendship, and the matter of corn having been arranged, and the rumors of the aid of the legions which were said to be coming with Pompey through Mauretania having been extinguished, many more distant states seceded from Afranius, and followed the friendship of Caesar

Quibus rebus perterritis animis adversariorum Caesar, ne semper magno circuitu per pontem equitatus esset mittendus, nactus idoneum locum, fossas pedum xxx in latitudinem complures facere instituit, quibus partem aliquam Sicoris averteret vadumque in eo flumine efficeret|At these things Caesar, terrified by the minds of his adversaries, lest the cavalry should always be sent in a great circuit across the bridge, having found a suitable place, he instituted the making of several trenches 300 feet in breadth, by which he might divert some part of Sicor, and make a ford in that river.

his paene effectis magnum in timorem Afranius Petreiusque perveniunt, ne omnino frumento pabuloque intercluderentur, quod multum Caesar equitatu valebat|Having almost accomplished these things, Afranius and Petreus came to a great fear, lest they should be entirely cut off from corn and fodder, for Caesar had a great number of cavalry.

itaque constituunt ipsi locis excedere et in Celtiberiam bellum transferre|and so they decided to leave their places and transfer the war to Celtiberia

huic consilio subfragabatur etiam illa res, quod ex duobus contrariis generibus quae superiore bello cum Sertorio steterant civitates, victae nomen atque imperium absentis Pompei timebant, quae in amicitia manserant magnis adfectae beneficiis eum diligebant, Caesaris autem erat in barbaris nomen obscurius|This plan was also undermined by the fact that the states of the two opposite classes which had stood in the previous war with Sertorius, feared the defeated name and the power of the absent Pompey, those who had remained in friendship loved him with great favors, but Caesar's name was more obscure among the barbarians

hic magnos equitatus magnaque auxilia exspectabant et suis locis bellum in hiemem ducere cogitabant|Here they were waiting for large cavalry and large reinforcements, and they were thinking of carrying on the war in their places during the winter

hoc inito consilio toto flumine Hibero navis conquiri et Otogesam adduci iubent|Having entered into this plan, they ordered ships to conquer the entire Hiberus river and bring Otogesa

id erat oppidum positum ad Hiberum miliaque passuum a castris aberat xxx|that was a town situated on the Hiberus, and 30 miles distant from the camp

ad eum locum fluminis navibus iunctis pontem imperant fieri legionesque duas flumen Sicorim transducunt castraque muniunt vallo pedum xii|At that place they order a bridge to be made by the ships of the river, and the two legions cross the river Sicorim, and fortify the camp with a rampart of twelve feet.

Qua re per exploratores cognita summo labore militum Caesar continuato diem noctemque opere in flumine avertendo huc iam deduxerat rem, ut equites, etsi difficulter atque aegre fiebat, possent tamen atque auderent flumen transire, pedites vero tantummodo umeris ac summo pectore extarent et cum altitudine aquae tum etiam rapiditate fluminis ad transeundum impedirentur|Caesar, being informed of this matter by the spies, and having continued day and night with the greatest exertions of the soldiers, by diverting the river, had already brought the matter to this point, so that the horsemen, though it was done with difficulty and difficulty, were still able and dared to cross the river, but the footmen could only stand up to their shoulders and to the top of their chests, and with the depth of the water and they were also prevented from crossing by the rapidity of the river

sed tamen eodem fere tempore pons in Hibero prope effectus nuntiabatur et in Sicori vadum reperiebatur|but still, about the same time, the bridge was reported near the end of Hiberus, and a ford was discovered at Sycor

Iam vero eo magis illi maturandum iter existimabant|Now, however, they considered the journey to be more mature

itaque duabus auxiliaribus cohortibus Ilerdae praesidio relictis omnibus copiis Sicorim transeunt et cum duabus legionibus, quas superioribus diebus traduxerant, castra coniungunt|therefore, leaving the garrison of Ilerda with the two auxiliary cohorts, they passed over Sicorim with all their forces, and joined the camp with the two legions which they had brought the previous days.

relinquebatur Caesari nihil, nisi uti equitatu agmen adversariorum male haberet et carperet|nothing was left to Caesar, except that he should use the cavalry to take the enemy's train badly and pick it up

pons enim ipsius magnum circuitum habebat, ut multo breviore itinere illi ad Hiberum pervenire possent|for his bridge had a great circumference, so that they could reach Hiberus by a much shorter journey

equites ab eo missi flumen transeunt, et, cum de tertia vigilia Petreius atque Afranius castra movissent, repente sese ad novissimum agmen ostendunt, et magna multitudine circumfusa morari atque iter impedire incipiunt|sent by him, the horsemen crossed the river, and when, on the third watch, Petreius and Afranius had moved their camp, they suddenly showed themselves to the last column, and, surrounded by a great multitude, began to tarry and obstruct the way.

Prima luce ex superioribus locis, quae Caesaris castris erant coniuncta, cernebatur equitatus nostri proelio novissimos illorum premi vehementer ac nonnumquam sustinere extremum agmen atque interrumpi, alias ferri signa et universarum cohortium impetu nostros propelli, dein rursus conversos insequi|At first light, from the higher places which were connected with Caesar's camp, our cavalry were seen to press hard upon the last of them in the battle, and sometimes to support and cut off the last column, at other times to drive off our iron standards and the charge of all the cohorts, and then again to pursue them who had turned back.

totis vero castris milites circulari et dolere hostem ex manibus dimitti, bellum necessario longius duci, centurionesque tribunosque militum adire atque obsecrare, ut per eos Caesar certior fieret, ne labori suo neu periculo parceret|but he sent the soldiers of the whole camp to circulate, and to let the enemy out of their hands, so that the war must be carried on further, and the centurions and tribunes of the soldiers to go and beseech them, that by them Caesar might be more assured, that he might spare neither his labor nor his danger.

paratos esse sese, posse et audere ea transire flumen, qua traductus esset equitatus|that they were ready, able and daring to cross the river by which the cavalry had been transported

quorum studio et vocibus excitatus Caesar, etsi timebat tantae magnitudini fluminis exercitum obicere, conandum tamen atque experiendum iudicat|Caesar, roused by their zeal and voices, though he feared to face an army of so great a river, nevertheless decides to try and try it.

itaque infirmiores milites ex omnibus centuriis deligi iubet, quorum aut animus aut vires videbantur sustinere non posse|therefore he ordered the weaker soldiers to be chosen from all the centuries, whose either mind or strength seemed to be unable to endure

hos cum legione una praesidio castris relinquit|He leaves these with the legion to guard the camp

reliquas legiones expeditas educit magnoque numero iumentorum in flumine supra atque infra constituto traducit exercitum|He brought out the rest of the legions in readiness, and, having arranged a large number of cattle above and below the river, led the army across

pauci ex his militibus ablati flumine ab equitatu excipiuntur ac sublevantur|a few of these soldiers, carried away by the river, were received by the cavalry and relieved

interit tamen nemo|but no one perishes

traducto incolumi exercitu copias instruit triplicemque aciem ducere incipit|having brought the army unharmed, he marshals his forces and begins to lead a three-pronged line

ac tantum fuit in militibus studii, ut milium vi ad iter addito ad vadum circuitu magnaque fluminis mora interposita eos, qui de tertia vigilia exissent, ante horam diei viiii consequerentur|and so much was the diligence of the soldiers, that, adding a force of a mile to the march, to circumambulate the ford, and interposing a great delay in the river, they overtook those who had set out on the third watch before the hour of the eighth day.

Quos ubi Afranius procul visos cum Petreio conspexit, nova re perterritus locis superioribus consistit aciemque instruit|When Afranius saw them at a distance with Petreius, he, terrified at the new thing, halted at the higher places, and drew up his line of battle.

Caesar in campis exercitum reficit, ne defessum proelio obiciat|Caesar restores his army in the fields, so as not to charge it exhausted with battle

rursus conantis progredi insequitur et moratur|again trying to advance, he pursues and stops

illi necessario maturius quam constituerant, castra ponunt|they necessarily set up camp earlier than they had planned

suberant enim montes atque a milibus passuum v itinera difficilia atque angusta excipiebant|for the mountains had come down, and from thousands of miles away they faced difficult and narrow roads

hos montes intrare cupiebant, ut equitatum effugerent Caesaris praesidiisque in angustiis collocatis exercitum itinere prohiberent, ipsi sine periculo ac timore Hiberum copias traducerent|they desired to enter these mountains, that they might escape Caesar's cavalry, and, having placed the army in the straits, stop their march;

quod fuit illis conandum atque omni ratione efficiendum|which they had to try and accomplish by all means

sed totius diei pugna atque itineris labore defessi rem in posterum diem distulerunt|but being exhausted by the whole day's battle and the toil of the journey, they postponed the matter until the next day

Caesar quoque in proximo colle castra ponit|Caesar also encamps on a nearby hill

Media circiter nocte iis qui aquandi causa longius a castris processerant, ab equitibus correptis, fit ab his certior Caesar duces adversariorum silentio copias castris educere|About midnight to those who had advanced farther from the camp for the sake of water, being escorted by the horsemen, Caesar informed the leaders of the adversaries that they were to withdraw the forces from the camp in silence.

quo cognito signum dari iubet et vasa militari more conclamari|when he learned this, he ordered the signal to be given, and the guns to be shouted in the manner of a soldier

illi exaudito clamore veriti ne noctu impediti sub onere confligere cogerentur aut ne ab equitatu Caesaris in angustiis tenerentur, iter supprimunt copiasque in castris continent|when they heard the cry, fearing lest they should be forced to fight under the burden of the night, or lest they should be held in straits by Caesar's cavalry, they stopped their march, and kept the troops in camp.

postero die Petreius cum paucis equitibus occulte ad exploranda loca proficiscitur|The next day Petreius set out secretly with a few horsemen to explore the places

hoc idem fit ex castris Caesaris|the same is done from Caesar's camp

mittitur  Decidius Saxa cum paucis qui loci naturam perspiciat|Decidius Saxa is sent with a few to see the nature of the place

uterque idem suis renuntiat: v milia passuum proxima intercedere itineris campestris, inde excipere loca aspera et montuosa|each of them gives the same message to their own: to cross a level road about 5 miles away, and from there to meet rough and mountainous places

qui prior has angustias occupaverit, ab hoc hostem prohiberi nihil esse negotii|he who had first occupied these straits, there was no business in stopping the enemy from this

Disputatur in consilio a Petreio atque Afranio et tempus profectionis quaeritur|It is discussed in the council by Petreius and Afranius and the time of departure is sought

plerique censebant, ut noctu iter facerent|most of them considered that they should travel by night

posse prius ad angustias veniri, quam sentiretur|that he might come to difficulties sooner than he felt

alii, quod pridie noctu conclamatum esset Caesaris castris, argumenti sumebant loco non posse clam exiri|others, that there had been a clamor in Caesar's camp the night before, took it as an argument that they could not go out secretly

circumfundi noctu equitatum Caesaris atque omnia loca atque itinera obsidere|surround Caesar's cavalry by night and lay siege to all places and roads

nocturnaque proelia esse vitanda, quod perterritus miles in civili dissensione timori magis quam religioni consulere consuerit|and nocturnal battles are to be avoided, because the frightened soldier in civil dissension is wont to consult fear rather than religion

at luce multum per se pudorem omnium oculis, multum etiam tribunorum militum et centurionum praesentiam adferre, quibus rebus coerceri milites et in officio contineri soleant|but to bring to light a great deal of shame in the eyes of all, and the presence of many tribunes of soldiers and centurions, by which things the soldiers are accustomed to be checked and kept in their duty

quare omni ratione esse interdiu perrumpendum|wherefore by all means it must be broken during the day

etsi aliquo accepto detrimento, tamen summa exercitus salva locum quem petant capi posse|though with some loss, yet the whole of the army saved the place which they sought to be captured

haec vincit in consilio sententia, et prima luce postridie constituunt proficisci|This decision prevails in the plan, and they decide to set out at the first light of the next day

Caesar exploratis regionibus albente caelo omnes copias castris educit, magnoque circuitu nullo certo itinere exercitum ducit|Caesar, having explored the regions, led out all the forces of the camp under a white sky, and led the army in a great circuit, without any definite route.

nam quae itinera ad Hiberum atque Otogesam pertinebant, castris hostium oppositis tenebantur|for the roads which belonged to Hiberus and Otogesa were held opposite the camp of the enemy

ipsi erant transcendendae valles maximae ac difficillimae, saxa multis locis praerupta iter impediebant, ut arma per manus necessario traderentur militesque inermes sublevatique alii ab aliis magnam partem itineris conficerent|The valleys themselves were the largest and most difficult to cross, and the rocks in many places obstructed the way, so that the arms were necessarily delivered by hand, and the unarmed soldiers were relieved, one by one, to complete a great part of the journey.

sed hunc laborem recusabat nemo, quod eum omnium laborum finem fore existimabant, si hostem Hibero intercludere et frumento prohibere potuissent|but no one refused this labor, because they thought that it would be the end of all labors, if they could shut out the enemy of the Hebrews and stop the corn

Ac primo Afraniani milites visendi causa laeti ex castris procurrebant contumeliosisque vocibus prosequebantur nostros: necessarii victus inopia coactos fugere atque ad Ilerdam reverti|And at first the soldiers of the Afranians, glad to see them, ran from the camp, and pursued our men with insulting voices;

erat enim iter a proposito diversum, contrariamque in partem iri videbatur|for the journey was different from that intended, and seemed to be going in the opposite direction

duces vero eorum consilium suum laudibus ferebant, quod se castris tenuissent|but their leaders praised their plan, because they had kept their camp

multumque eorum opinionem adiuvabat, quod sine iumentis impedimentisque ad iter profectos videbant, ut non posse inopiam diutius sustinere confiderent|and their belief was greatly supported by the fact that they saw that they were safe to travel without cattle and hindrances, so that they did not believe that they could endure the want any longer.

sed ubi paulatim retorqueri agmen ad dextram conspexerunt iamque primos superare regionem castrorum animadverterunt, nemo erat adeo tardus aut fugiens laboris quin statim castris exeundum atque occurrendum putaret|but when they gradually turned back and saw the column to the right, and perceived that they were the first to pass the country of the camp, no one was so slow or evasive as to think of going out and meeting the camp at once.

conclamatur ad arma, atque omnes copiae paucis praesidio relictis cohortibus exeunt rectoque ad Hiberum itinere contendunt|a call to arms was made, and all the troops, leaving behind a few garrisons, marched out, and marched straight towards the Hebrews.

Erat in celeritate omne positum certamen, utri prius angustias montesque occuparent|The contest was all about speed;

sed exercitum Caesaris viarum difficultates tardabant, Afrani copias equitatus Caesaris insequens morabatur|but Caesar's army was delayed by the difficulties of the roads, and Afranus was delayed in pursuing Caesar's cavalry

res tamen ab Afranianis huc erat necessario deducta, ut, si priores montis quos petebant attigissent, ipsi periculum vitarent, impedimenta totius exercitus cohortisque in castris relictas servare non possent|but the matter was necessarily brought hither by the Afranians, so that if the former had reached the mountains which they were seeking, they themselves would have avoided danger;

quibus interclusis exercitu Caesaris auxilium ferri nulla ratione poterat|by which Caesar's army, being cut off, could not be helped by any reason

confecit prior iter Caesar atque ex magnis rupibus nactus planitiem in hac contra hostem aciem instruit|Caesar completed his first march, and having obtained a plain from the great rocks, he drew up the enemy's line against it

Afranius, cum ab equitatu novissimum agmen premeretur et ante se hostem videret, collem quendam nactus ibi constitit|Afranius, when the last column of the cavalry was pressed on, and seeing the enemy before him, having reached a certain hill, halted there

ex eo loco iiii caetratorum cohortis in montem qui erat in conspectu omnium excelsissimus mittit|from that place he sends a band of 3 soldiers to the mountain which was the highest in the sight of all

hunc magno cursu concitatos iubet occupare, eo consilio, uti ipse eodem omnibus copiis contenderet et mutato itinere iugis Otogesam perveniret|He ordered them to seize him with great speed, with the intention that he himself should march with all his forces and reach Otogesa by changing his route.

hunc cum obliquo itinere caetrati peterent, conspicatus equitatus Caesaris in cohortis impetum facit|Caesar's cavalry, having seen him, made an attack on the cohort

nec minimam partem temporis equitum vim caetrati sustinere potuerunt omnesque ab eis circumventi in conspectu utriusque exercitus interficiuntur|and the horsemen could not withstand the force of the cavalry for the least part of the time, and all those who were surrounded by them were slain in the presence of both armies.

Erat occasio bene gerendae rei|It was an opportunity to do well

neque vero id Caesarem fugiebat tanto sub oculis accepto detrimento perterritum exercitum sustinere non posse, praesertim circumdatum undique equitatu, cum in loco aequo atque aperto confligeretur|nor did he flee from Caesar, having received so great a loss under his eyes, that the terrified army could not withstand it, especially when it was surrounded on all sides by cavalry, when it was engaged in a level and open place

idque ex omnibus partibus ab eo flagitabatur|and this was demanded of him from all quarters

concurrebant legati, centuriones tribunique militum: ne dubitaret proelium committere|the ambassadors, the centurions, and the tribunes of the soldiers concurred: that he should not hesitate to commit battle

omnium esse militum paratissimos animos|that the hearts of all the soldiers were ready

Afranianos contra multis rebus sui timoris signa misisse: quod suis non subvenissent, quod de colle non decederent, quod vix equitum incursus sustinerent collatisque in unum locum signis conferti neque ordines neque signa servarent|that the Afranians sent signs of their fear against many things: that they did not come to the aid of their own, that they did not retire from the hill, that they scarcely withstood the charge of the horsemen, and gathered together in one place with their standards, neither kept their ranks nor their standards

quodsi iniquitatem loci timeret, datum iri tamen aliquo loco pugnandi facultatem, quod certe inde decedendum esset Afranio nec sine aqua permanere posset|if he feared the iniquity of the place, he would nevertheless have been given the opportunity to fight in some place, because Afranius would certainly have to retire from there and could not continue without water

Caesar in eam spem venerat se sine pugna et sine volnere suorum rem conficere posse, quod re frumentaria adversarios interclusisset|Caesar had come to it in the hope that he would be able to accomplish the matter without a fight and without the displeasure of his people, because he had intercepted his adversaries in the matter of corn.

cur etiam secundo proelio aliquos ex suis amitteret? cur volnerari pateretur optime meritos de se milites? cur denique fortunam periclitaretur? praesertim cum non minus esset imperatoris consilio superare quam gladio|Why should he lose some of his own in the second battle? why should the most meritorious soldiers be allowed to be wounded? Why, in short, should he risk his fortune? especially since it was no less to overcome by the emperor's counsel than by the sword

movebatur etiam misericordia civium, quos interficiendos videbat|He was also moved by compassion for the citizens whom he saw being killed

quibus salvis atque incolumibus rem optinere malebat|with whom he wished to hope for the matter safe and sound

hoc consilium Caesaris plerisque non probabatur|this plan of Caesar was not approved by most of the people

milites vero palam inter se loquebantur, quoniam talis occasio victoriae dimitteretur, etiam cum vellet Caesar, sese non esse pugnaturos|but the soldiers were speaking openly among themselves, because such an opportunity of victory should be allowed, even when Caesar wished, that they would not fight among themselves

ille in sua sententia perseverat et paulum ex eo loco digreditur, ut timorem adversariis minuat|he persists in his opinion and departs a little from that position, in order to lessen the fear of his adversaries

Petreius atque Afranius oblata facultate in castra sese referunt|Petreius and Afranius returned to the camp with the opportunity offered

Caesar praesidiis in montibus dispositis omni ad Hiberum intercluso itinere, quam proxime potest hostium castris, castra communit|Caesar having stationed his garrisons in the mountains, having cut off all the way to Hiberus, as near as he could to the enemy's camp, made a common camp.

Postero die duces adversariorum perturbati, quod omnem rei frumentariae fluminisque Hiberi spem dimiserant, de reliquis rebus consultabant|On the following day the leaders of the adversaries, dismayed, because they had given up all hope of the corn and the river Heberus, consulted about the rest of the matter.

erat unum iter, Ilerdam si reverti vellent, alterum, si Tarraconem peterent|there was one way, if they wanted to return to Ilerda, and another if they wanted to go to Tarracon

haec consiliantibus eis nuntiantur aquatores ab equitatu premi nostro|These things were reported to the councilors by the watermen from the cavalry of our chief

qua re cognita crebras stationes disponunt equitum et cohortium alariarum legionariasque intericiunt cohortis vallumque ex castris ad aquam ducere incipiunt, ut intra munitionem et sine timore et sine stationibus aquari possent|when they learned of this fact, they set up frequent posts for the cavalry and the winged cohorts, and killed the legionaries of the cohort, and began to lead the ramparts from the camp to the water, so that they could water within the fortifications and without fear and without stations

id opus inter se Petreius atque Afranius partiuntur ipsique perficiendi operis causa longius progrediuntur|Petreius and Afranius divide this work among themselves, and they themselves advance further for the purpose of completing the work

Quorum discessu liberam nacti milites colloquiorum facultatem volgo procedunt, et quem quisque in castris notum aut municipem habebat, conquirit atque evocat|After their departure, the soldiers, freed from the opportunity of conversation, proceeded to the general, and each one in the camp had an acquaintance or a town, he sought out and summoned

primum agunt gratias omnes omnibus, quod sibi perterritis pridie pepercissent|first they all give thanks to all that they had spared them the day before in their terror

eorum se beneficio vivere|to live in their favor

deinde imperatoris fidem quaerunt, rectene se illi sint commissuri, et quod non ab initio fecerint armaque quod cum hominibus necessariis et consanguineis contulerint, queruntur|then they ask for the emperor's loyalty, whether it is right that they should commit themselves to him, and they complain that they did not from the beginning make and arms that they brought with necessary men and relatives

his provocati sermonibus fidem ab imperatore de Petrei atque Afrani vita petunt, nequod in se scelus concepisse neu suos prodidisse videantur|Provoked by these words, they ask the emperor's trust for the lives of Petraeus and Afranus, lest they be seen to have conceived any crime in themselves, or to have betrayed their own people.

quibus confirmatis rebus se statim signa translaturos confirmant legatosque de pace primorum ordinum centuriones ad Caesarem mittunt|having been confirmed by these things, they confirm that they will immediately transfer the signals, and send ambassadors of the first order of peace to Caesar, the centurions

interim alii suos in castra invitandi causa adducunt, alii ab suis abducuntur, adeo ut una castra iam facta ex binis viderentur|meanwhile some brought their own people into the camp for the purpose of inviting them, others were taken away from their own people, so much so that it seemed that one camp had already been made of two

compluresque tribuni militum et centuriones ad Caesarem veniunt seque ei commendant|and a number of military tribunes and centurions came to Caesar and commended him

idem hoc fit a principibus Hispaniae, quos illi evocaverant et secum in castris habebant obsidum loco|The same thing is done by the princes of Spain, whom they had summoned and had with them in the camp as hostages

hi suos notos hospitesque quaerebant, per quem quisque eorum aditum commendationis haberet ad Caesarem|these sought their acquaintances and guests, by whom each of them might have access to Caesar's recommendation

Afrani etiam filius adulescens de sua ac parentis sui salute cum Caesare per Sulpicium legatum agebat|The young son of Afranus also made a message to Caesar through Sulpicius about his safety and that of his parents

erant plena laetitia et gratulatione omnia et eorum qui tanta pericula vitasse, et eorum qui sine volnere tantas res confecisse videbantur, magnumque fructum suae pristinae lenitatis omnium iudicio Caesar ferebat, consiliumque eius a cunctis probabatur|all were full of joy and congratulation, both of those who had avoided so many dangers, and of those who seemed to have accomplished so many things unwillingly;

Quibus rebus nuntiatis Afranius ab instituto opere discedit seque in castra recipit, sic paratus, ut videbatur, ut, quicumque accidisset casus, hunc quieto et aequo animo ferret|When Afranius was informed of these things, he departed from his appointed work, and returned to the camp, so prepared, as it seemed, that, whatever accident might befall him, he would bear it with calmness and equanimity.

Petreius vero non deserit sese|But Peterius did not abandon himself

armat familiam|arms the family

cum hac et praetoria cohorte caetratorum barbarisque equitibus paucis, beneficiariis suis, quos suae custodiae causa habere consueverat, improviso ad vallum advolat, colloquia militum interrumpit, nostros repellit a castris, quos deprendit, interficit|with this and the flagship, a band of cavalry and a few barbarian horsemen, his benefactors, whom he was accustomed to have for the purpose of his guard, flies unexpectedly to the rampart, interrupts the conversation of the soldiers, drives back our men from the camp, whom he captures, and kills

reliqui coeunt inter se et repentino periculo exterriti sinistras sagis involvunt gladiosque destringunt atque ita se a caetratis equitibusque defendunt castrorum propinquitate confisi seque in castra recipiunt et ab iis cohortibus quae erant in statione ad portas, defenduntur|the rest join together, and, terrified by the sudden danger, wrap up their left arrows and draw their swords, and thus defend themselves from the musketeers and the horsemen.

Quibus rebus confectis flens Petreius manipulos circumit militesque appellat, neu se neu Pompeium absentem imperatorem suum adversariis ad supplicium tradant, obsecrat|When these things were done, Petreius, weeping, went round the troops, and besought the soldiers, that neither himself nor Pompey, their absent emperor, should be handed over to their adversaries for execution.

fit celeriter concursus in praetorium|there is a rapid rush to the headquarters

postulat, ut iurent omnes se exercitum ducesque non deserturos neque prodituros neque sibi separatim a reliquis consilium capturos|demands that they all swear that they will not desert the army and their leaders, nor betray them, nor take counsel separately from the rest

princeps in haec verba iurat ipse|The prince himself swears by these words

idem iusiurandum adigit Afranium|Afranius makes the same oath

subsequuntur tribuni militum centurionesque|the tribunes and centurions follow

centuriatim producti milites idem iurant|Soldiers produced for centuries swear the same oath

edicunt, penes quem quisque sit Caesaris miles, ut producat: productos palam in praetorio interficiunt|they proclaim that it is up to each one who is Caesar's soldier to produce: they kill the products openly in the capital

sed plerosque ii qui receperant celant noctuque per vallum emittunt|but those who had received them hid most of them, and sent them out by night through the wall

sic terror oblatus a ducibus, crudelitas in supplicio, nova religio iurisiurandi spem praesentis deditionis sustulit mentesque militum convertit et rem ad pristinam belli rationem redegit|thus the terror offered by the generals, the cruelty of the execution, the new religion of swearing, took away the hope of a present surrender, and turned the minds of the soldiers, and reduced the matter to the former method of war.

Caesar, qui milites adversariorum in castra per tempus colloqui venerant, summa diligentia conquiri et remitti iubet|Caesar ordered that the soldiers of the adversaries, who had come to the camp for a time to confer, should be captured with the greatest care and sent back

sed ex numero tribunorum militum centurionumque nonnulli sua voluntate apud eum remanserunt|but of the number of the tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions some remained with him of their own accord

quos ille postea magno in honore habuit|whom he afterwards held in great esteem

centuriones in priores ordines, equites Romanos in tribunicium restituit honorem|He restored the honor of the centurions to the former ranks, the Roman horsemen to the tribune

Premebantur Afraniani pabulatione, aquabantur aegre|The Afranians were pressed for food, and watered with difficulty

frumenti copiam legionarii nonnullam habebant, quod dierum †xxii ab Ilerda frumentum iussi erant efferre, caetrati auxiliaresque nullam, quorum erant et facultates ad parandum exiguae et corpora insueta ad onera portanda|The legionaries had some supply of corn, because they had been ordered by Ilerda to bring up the corn 22 days ago, and the cavalry had none to help them;

itaque magnus eorum cotidie numerus ad Caesarem perfugiebat|and therefore every day a great number of them fled to Caesar

in his erat angustiis res|in these difficulties was the matter

sed ex propositis consiliis duobus explicitius videbatur Ilerdam reverti, quod ibi paulum frumenti reliquerant|but from the proposed plans it seemed more explicit to the two that they should return to Ilerda, because they had left a little grain there

ibi se reliquum consilium explicaturos confidebant|there they trusted that they would unfold the rest of the plan

Tarraco aberat longius|Tarraco was further away

quo spatio plures rem posse casus recipere intellegebant|in which space they understood that they could receive the majority of cases

hoc probato consilio ex castris proficiscuntur|With this plan approved, they set out from the camp

Caesar equitatu praemisso, qui novissimum agmen carperet atque impediret, ipse cum legionibus subsequitur|Caesar himself followed with the legions, having advanced the cavalry, who were to intercept the last column and prevent it

nullum intercedebat tempus, quin extremi cum equitibus proeliarentur|no time passed without the last fighting with the horsemen

Genus erat hoc pugnae|This was a kind of battle

expeditae cohortes novissimum agmen claudebant pluresque in locis cam pestribus subsistebant|the expeditious cohorts closed the rear of the train, and many halted in places of cam pestilence

si mons erat ascendendus, facile ipsa loci natura periculum repellebat, quod ex locis superioribus, qui antecesserant, desuper ascendentis protegebant|if a mountain was to be ascended, the very nature of the place easily repelled the danger, because from the higher places which had gone before, they protected the ascent from above

cum vallis aut locus declivis suberat neque ii qui antecesserant morantibus opem ferre poterant, equites vero ex loco superiore in aversos tela coiciebant, tum magno erat in periculo res|when the valley or the place was sloping, and those who had gone before could not help those who were staying, but the horsemen from a higher place threw their weapons at the enemy, then things were in great danger

relinquebatur, ut cum eiusmodi locis esset adpropinquatum, legionum signa consistere iuberent magnoque impetu equitatum repellerent, eo submoto repente incitati cursu sese in vallis universi demitterent atque ita transgressi rursus in locis superioribus consisterent|It was left to him, that when he was near such places, they would order the standards of the legions to stand still, and drive back the cavalry with a great charge;

nam tantum ab equitum suorum auxiliis aberant, quorum numerum habebant magnum, ut eos superioribus perterritos proeliis in medium reciperent agmen ultroque eos tuerentur|for they were so far from the aid of their horsemen, of whom they had a great number, that, terrified by the battles which had preceded them, they received them into the middle of the column, and protected them on either side

quorum nulli ex itinere excedere licebat, quin ab equitatu Caesaris exciperetur|none of whom was permitted to leave the journey without being picked up by Caesar's cavalry

Tali dum pugnatur modo, lente atque paulatim proceditur crebroque, ut sint auxilio suis, subsistunt|While such a one is fighting, they advance slowly and little by little, and often, that they may be of their assistance, they stand

ut tum accidit|as it happened then

milia enim progressi iiii vehementiusque peragitati ab equitatu montem excelsum capiunt ibique una fronte contra hostem castra muniunt neque iumentis onera deponunt|for thousands of them advanced, and driven violently by the cavalry, they took a high mountain, and there fortified their camp with one front against the enemy, and did not put down their burdens of cattle.

ubi Caesaris castra posita tabernaculaque constituta et dimissos equites pabulandi causa animum adverterunt, sese subito proripiunt hora circiter sexta eiusdem diei et spem nacti morae discessu nostrorum equitum iter facere incipiunt|When Caesar's camp was pitched, and the tents were pitched, and the cavalry having been dismissed, they turned their attention to the cause of foraging.

qua re animum adversa Caesar refectis legionibus subsequitur, praesidio impedimentis paucas cohortis relinquit|on which occasion Caesar, having a contrary mind, followed with his renewed legions, leaving a few of his cohorts to guard the baggage

hora x subsequi, pabulatores equitesque revocari iubet|At 10:00 p.m. he ordered the foragers and horsemen to be recalled

celeriter equitatus ad cotidianum itineris officium revertitur|the cavalry quickly returned to the daily duty of the road

pugnatur acriter ad novissimum agmen, adeo ut paene terga convertant, compluresque milites, etiam nonnulli centuriones, interficiuntur|the last column was fought fiercely, so much so that they almost turned their backs, and several soldiers, including some centurions, were slain

instabat agmen Caesaris atque universum inminebat|Caesar's army was pressing forward and threatening the whole world

Tum vero neque ad explorandum idoneum locum castris neque ad progrediendum data facultate consistunt necessario et procul ab aqua et natura iniquo loco castra ponunt|But then, neither to explore a suitable place for the camp, nor to advance with the given ability, they necessarily stop, and far from water and nature, they camp in an unfair place.

sed isdem de causis Caesar, quae supra sunt demonstratae, proelio non lacessit|but for the same reasons, which have been shown above, Caesar did not join the battle

et eo die tabernacula statui passus non est, quo paratiores essent ad insequendum omnes, sive noctu sive interdiu erumperent|and on that day he did not suffer the tents to be set up, so that they would be more ready to pursue them all, whether they broke out by night or by day

illi animadverso vitio castrorum tota nocte munitiones proferunt castraque castris convertunt|they, in spite of the defect of the camp, put forward the fortifications all night, and turn the camp into camp

hoc idem postero die a prima luce faciunt totumque in ea re diem consumunt|the next day they do the same thing from the first light, and spend the whole day in it

sed quantum opere processerant et castra protulerant, tanto aberant ab aqua longius, et praesenti malo aliis malis remedia dabantur|but as much as they had proceeded with work and pitched their camp, so far were they from water, and remedies for the present evil were given to other evils

prima nocte aquandi causa nemo egreditur ex castris|on the first night no one went out of the camp for the sake of watering

proximo die praesidio in castris relicto universas ad aquam copias educunt, pabulatum emittitur nemo|the next day, leaving the garrison in the camp, they led all the troops to the water, no forage being sent out

his eos suppliciis male haberi Caesar et necessariam subire deditionem quam proelio decertare malebat|Caesar was displeased with these punishments, and he was unwilling to submit to the necessary surrender rather than to fight in battle

conatur tamen eos vallo fossaque circummunire, ut quam maxime repentinas eorum eruptiones demoretur|He endeavors, however, to surround them with ramparts and moats, so as to delay as much as possible their sudden eruptions

quo necessario descensuros existimabat|by which he thought that they would necessarily descend

illi et inopia pabuli adducti et quo essent ad iter expeditiores, omnia sarcinaria iumenta interfici iubent|they, and the want of fodder being brought, and where they would be more expedient for the journey, order all the beasts of burden to be killed

In his operibus consiliisque biduum consumitur|Two days are spent in these works and plans

tertio die magna iam pars operis Caesaris processerat|On the third day a large part of Caesar's work had already been carried out

illi impediendae reliquae munitionis causa hora circiter viiii signo dato legiones educunt aciemque sub castris instruunt|they being hindered by the rest of the fortifications, at about eight o'clock, at a signal, they brought out the legions and drew up in array under the camp

Caesar ab opere legiones revocat, equitatum omnem convenire iubet, aciem instruit|Caesar recalls the legions from work, orders all the cavalry to assemble, and prepares the battle

contra opinionem enim militum famamque omnium videri proelium defugisse magnum detrimentum adferebat|for contrary to the opinion of the soldiers and the reputation of all, he was seen to have escaped the battle, and brought great loss

sed eisdem de causis, quae sunt cognitae, quominus dimicare vellet, movebatur, atque hoc etiam magis, quod spatii brevitas etiam in fugam coniectis adversariis non multum ad summam victoriae iuvare poterat|but for the same reasons which have been known, he was moved to avoid fighting;

non enim amplius pedum milibus duobus a castris castra distabant|for the camp was not more than two thousand feet distant from the camp

hinc duas partes acies occupabant duae|hence the two occupied two parts of the line

tertia vacabat ad incursum atque impetum militum relicta|the third was spared for the attack and attack of the soldiers

si proelium committeretur, propinquitas castrorum celerem superatis ex fuga receptum dabat|if a battle were to be undertaken, the proximity of the camp would enable them to be speedily overcome and retaken by flight

hac de causa constituerat signa inferentibus resistere, prior proelio non lacessere|for this reason he resolved to resist those who brought the signals, and not to fight before the battle

Acies erat Afraniana duplex legionum v, tertium in subsidiis locum alariae cohortes obtinebant|The Afranian line was double the five legions, and the third place in reserve was occupied by the alarian cohorts

Caesaris triplex|Caesar's triple

sed primam aciem quaternae cohortes ex v legionibus tenebant, has subsidiariae ternae et rursus aliae totidem suae cuiusque legionis subsequebantur|but the first line was held by four cohorts from five legions, and these were followed by three auxiliaries, and again by others of the same number of their respective legions

sagittarii funditoresque media continebantur acie, equitatus latera cingebat|the archers and lancers were kept in the middle of the line, and the cavalry surrounded the flanks

tali instructa acie tenere uterque propositum videbatur: Caesar, nisi coactus proelium non committeret, ille, ut opera Caesaris impediret|It seemed to be the purpose of each of them to maintain such an array:

producitur tamen res aciesque ad solis occasum continentur|yet things are produced, and the lines are contained at the setting of the sun

inde utrique in castra discedunt|from there both of them left for the camp

postero die munitiones institutas Caesar parat perficere|The next day Caesar prepares to complete the fortifications established

illi vadum fluminis Sicoris temptare, si transire possent|they were to attempt the ford of the river Sicor, if they could cross

qua re animadversa Caesar Germanos levis armaturae equitumque partem flumen traicit crebrasque in ripis custodias disponit|When Caesar noticed this, he crossed the river with light armor and part of the cavalry, and placed frequent guards on the banks.

Tandem omnibus rebus obsessi quartum iam diem sine pabulo retentis iumentis, aquae lignorum frumenti inopia, colloquium petunt et id, si fieri possit, semoto a militibus loco|At last, being besieged by all things, for the fourth day now, without fodder for keeping the cattle, for want of water, wood, and grain, they ask for a conference, and that, if possible, in a place remote from the soldiers.

ubi id a Caesare negatum, et palam si colloqui vellent, concessum est, datur obsidis loco Caesari filius Afrani|when this was denied by Caesar, and it was granted openly if they wished to speak, the son of Afranus was given instead of hostages to Caesar

venitur in eum locum quem Caesar delegit|he comes to the place which Caesar has chosen

audiente utroque exercitu loquitur Afranius: non esse aut ipsis aut militibus suscensendum, quod fidem erga imperatorem suum Cn|Afranius, listening to both armies, speaks: that neither they nor the soldiers should go up, because loyalty to their emperor Cn

Pompeium conservare voluerint|They wished to preserve Pompey

sed satis iam fecisse officio satisque supplicii tulisse perpessos omnium rerum inopiam|but that they had already done enough in duty, and had suffered enough in execution, that they suffered from the want of all things

nunc vero paene ut feras circummunitos prohiberi aqua, prohiberi ingressu, neque corpore dolorem neque animo ignominiam ferre posse|now, however, almost like wild beasts surrounded by water, they were prevented from entering, and could neither bear the pain of the body nor the disgrace of the mind

itaque se victos confiteri|therefore to confess that they were defeated

orare atque obsecrare, siqui locus misericordiae relinquatur, ne ad ultimum supplicium progredi necesse habeant|to pray and beseech, that there may be room for mercy, that they may not have to proceed to the last execution

haec quam potest demississime et subiectissime exponit|He explains these things as lowly and submissively as he can

Ad ea Caesar respondit: nulli omnium has partis vel querimoniae vel miserationis minus convenisse|To which Caesar answered: that none of them met with any less complaint or pity

reliquos enim omnis officium suum praestitisse: se, qui etiam bona condicione et loco et tempore aequo confligere noluerit, ut quam integerrima essent ad pacem omnia|for the rest had done all his duty;

exercitum suum, qui iniuria etiam accepta suisque interfectis, quos in sua potestate habuerit, conservarit et texerit|his army, which, even after receiving injury and slaying those whom he had in his power, preserved and covered

illius denique exercitus milites, qui per se de concilianda pace egerint, qua in re omnium suorum vitae consulendum putarint|In short, the soldiers of that army, who by their own means were engaged in conciliating a peace, in which they thought it advisable to consult in the matter of the lives of all their people

sic omnium ordinum partis in misericordia constitisse, ipsos duces a pace abhorruisse|so that the part of all ranks stood in mercy, and that the leaders themselves were repulsed from peace

eos neque colloquii neque indutiarum iura servasse et homines imperitos et per colloquium deceptos crudelissime interfecisse|that they had preserved neither the rights of conversation nor of those who were clothed;

accidisse igitur his, quod plerumque hominibus nimia pertinacia atque adrogantia accidere soleat, uti eo recurrant et id cupidissime petant, quod paulo ante contempserint|therefore it happened to them, that which usually happens to men with too much obstinacy and insolence, that they resorted to it and eagerly sought that which they had despised a little before

neque nunc se illorum humilitate neque aliqua temporis opportunitate postulare, quibus rebus opes augeantur suae|nor should he now demand from their humility, nor at any opportune time, by which things his riches may be increased

sed eos exercitus, quos contra se multos iam annos aluerint, velle dimitti|but they were willing to let go those armies whom they had been raising against them for many years

neque enim sex legiones alia de causa missas in Hispaniam septimamque ibi conscriptam, neque tot tantasque classis paratas neque submissos duces rei militaris peritos|for there were not six legions sent into Spain for any other reason, and the seventh there recruited;

nihil horum ad pacandas Hispanias, nihil ad usum provinciae provisum, quae propter diuturnitatem pacis nullum auxilium desiderarit|nothing of these things was provided for the pacification of Spain;

omnia haec iam pridem contra se parari|All these things had long since been prepared against him

in se novi generis imperia constitui, ut idem ad portas urbanis praesideat rebus et duas bellicosissimas provincias absens tot annos obtineat|I established in him governments of a new kind, so that he may preside over affairs at the gates of the cities, and take possession of the two most warlike provinces, having been absent for so many years

in se iura magistratuum commutari, ne ex praetura et consulatu, ut semper, sed per paucos probati et electi in provincias mittantur|that the rights of the magistrates should be changed in themselves, so that they should not be sent to the provinces from the praetorium and consulship, as always, but by a few approved and elected

in se aetatis excusationem nihil valere, quin superioribus bellis probati ad optinendos [10] exercitus evocentur|In itself the excuse of age is of no avail, unless the armies which have been tried in previous wars are called upon to obtain [10]

in se uno non servari, quod sit omnibus datum semper imperatoribus, ut rebus feliciter gestis aut cum honore aliquo aut certe sine ignominia domum revertantur exercitumque dimittant|not to be preserved in himself alone, that it should always be given to all emperors, that when things have been successfully accomplished, they may return home with some honor, or at least without dishonor, and dismiss the army

[11] quae tamen omnia et se tulisse patienter et esse laturum|[11] which, however, he had borne patiently and that he would pass away

neque nunc id agere, ut ab illis abductum exercitum teneat ipse, quod tamen sibi difficile non sit, sed ne illi habeant, quo [12] contra se uti possint|nor should he do so now, that he himself should hold the army which had been taken from them, which, however, would not be difficult for him, but that they should not have any with which they could use [12] against him

proinde, ut esset dictum, provinciis excederent exercitumque dimitterent|therefore, as had been said, they should leave the provinces and dismiss the army

si id sit factum, se nociturum nemini|if that is done, no one will be harmed

hanc unam atque extremam esse pacis condicionem|that this is the only and extreme condition of peace

Id vero militibus fuit pergratum et iucundum, ut ex ipsa significatione cognosci potuit, ut, qui aliquid iusti incommodi expectavissent, ultro praemium missionis ferrent|This indeed was agreeable and pleasant to the soldiers, as may be known from the very meaning, that those who had expected some just inconvenience might, on the other hand, carry the reward of the mission.

nam cum de loco et de tempore eius rei controversia inferretur, et voce et manibus universi ex vallo, ubi constiterant, significare coeperunt, ut statim dimitterentur, neque omni interposita fide firmum esse posse, si in aliud tempus differretur|for when a controversy arose concerning the place and time of this affair, and with voice and hands they all began to signify from the rampart where they were stationed, that they should be dismissed at once, and that no interposed faith could be established if it were postponed to another time.

paucis cum esset in utramque partem verbis disputatum, res huc deducitur, ut ii qui habeant domicilium aut possessionem in Hispania, statim, reliqui ad Varum flumen dimittantur|After a few words had been discussed on both sides, the matter was brought to this point, so that those who had a domicile or property in Spain should immediately be sent, the rest to the river Varus

nequid iis noceatur neu quis invitus sacramentum dicere cogatur, a Caesare cavetur|that no one should be harmed by them, or that anyone should be forced to say the sacrament against his will, Caesar would take care

Caesar ex eo tempore, dum ad flumen Varum veniatur, se frumentum daturum pollicetur|From that time Caesar promised to give him corn as long as he came to the river Varus

addit etiam, ut quid quisque eorum in bello amiserit, quae sint penes milites suos, iis qui amiserant restituatur|He also adds that what each of them had lost in the war, such as his soldiers, should be restored to those who had lost

militibus aequa facta aestimatione pecuniam pro his rebus dissolvit|A fair assessment of the soldiers was made, and the money for these things was dissolved

quascumque postea controversias inter se milites habuerunt, sua sponte ad Caesarem in ius adierunt|whatever controversies afterwards the soldiers had among themselves, they of their own accord went to Caesar for justice

Petreius atque Afranius cum stipendium ab legionibus paene seditione facta flagitaretur, cuius illi diem nondum venisse dicerent, Caesar ut cognosceret, postulatum est, eoque utrique, quod statuit, contenti fuerunt|When Petreius and Afranius were demanded by the legions almost in rebellion, the day of which they said had not yet come, it was demanded that Caesar should know, and both were satisfied with what he decided.

parte circiter tertia exercitus eo biduo dimissa duas legiones suas antecedere, reliquas subsequi iussit, ut non longo inter se spatio castra facerent, eique negotio  Fufium Calenum legatum praefecit|About a third part of the army having been dismissed in those two days, he ordered two of his legions to advance, and ordered the rest to follow, so that they would not encamp at a great distance from each other,

hoc eius praescripto ex Hispania ad Varum flumen est iter factum, atque ibi reliqua pars exercitus dimissa est|By his order a march was made from Spain to the river Varus, and there the remainder of the army was dismissed
