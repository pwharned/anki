THE SUPPLEMENT of DIONYSIUS VOSSIUS TO CAESAR'S FIRST BOOK of THE CIVIL WA I think it needless to say any thing here, in opposition to those who pretend, that the following Commentaries, concerning the Civil War, were not penned by Caesar himself
We have not only the express testimony of Suetonius to the contrary, but the very style sufficiently declares, that Caesar alone could be the author of the work
There is room however to suspect, from the abrupt manner in which the subject is introduced, that the beginning of this first book is wanting: for history takes notice of several previous facts, of which no mention is made here
I have therefore collected out of Plutarch, Appian, and Dion, as much as was necessary to connect this and the former Commentary, and fancy it will not be disagreeable to the reader, to offer it here by way of preface
Gaul being wholly reduced, Caesar, upon his arrival in Lombardy, thought proper, for many reasons, to send deputies to Rome, to demand the consulship, and a prolongation of his command
Pompey, who, though averse to Caesar's interest, had not yet openly declared against him, neither furthered nor opposed his request
But the consuls Marcellus and Lentulus, who had already joined the party of his enemies, resolved by every method in their power to frustrate the design
Marcellus scrupled not to add other injuries to that of which we speak
For Caesar had lately planted a colony at Novocomum in Cisalpine Gaul
and Marcellus, not satisfied with stripping the inhabitants of the privilege of Roman citizens, seized one of their chief magistrates at Rome, ordered him to be scourged, and then dismissed him to carry his complaints to Caesar, an ignominy from which all free citizens were expressly exempted by the laws
While affairs were in this train,  Curio, tribune of the people, came to Caesar in Gaul
This nobleman, after many attempts in behalf of the commonwealth, and to promote Caesar's interest
finding at length all his endeavours without effect, fled from Rome, to avoid the malice of his enemies, and informed Caesar of all that was transacted against him
Caesar received him with great marks of respect, as well on account of his rank in the commonwealth, as the many services he had done himself and the state
and thanked him for the signal zeal he had shown in his cause
But Curio advised him, since his enemies were now openly preparing for war, to draw his army together without delay, and rescue the commonwealth from the tyranny of an aspiring faction
Caesar, though fully satisfied of the truth of Curio's report, resolved to sacrifice all other considerations to the public tranquillity, that no man might justly charge him with being the author of a civil war
He therefore only petitioned by his friends, that the government of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum, with the command of two legions, might be continued to him, in all which his principal aim was, by the equity of his demands, to induce his enemies to grant peace to the commonwealth
These offers appeared so reasonable, that even Pompey himself knew not how to oppose them
But the consuls still continuing inflexible, Caesar wrote a letter to the senate, wherein, after briefly enumerating his exploits and services, he requested them not to deprive him of the benefit of the people's favour, who had permitted him to sue for the consulship in his absence
He protested his readiness, if such was the resolution of the senate and people of Rome, to dismiss his army, provided Pompey did the same: but could by no means resolve, so long as he continued in command and authority, to divest himself of troops, and lay himself open to the injuries of his enemies
Curio was commissoned to carry this letter, who travelling with incredible despatch, reached Rome in three days (a distance of a hundred and sixty miles,) before the beginning of January, and ere the consuls could get any thing determined relating to Caesar's command
Curio, upon his arrival, refused to part with the letter, resolving not to deliver it but in full senate, and when the tribunes of the people were present: for he was apprehensive, should he do otherwise, that the consuls would suppress it
Caesar's letter being delivered to the consuls, the tribunes, with much difficulty, procured it a reading in the senate
but could by no means prevail to have his demands brought under deliberation
The consuls proposed to debate upon the state of the republic
" Lentulus promised to stand by the senate and the people, if they would deliver their sentiments with freedom and courage
but if they regarded Caesar, and affected to court his friendship, as had been the practice for some time past, he knew, he told them, what he had to do, and was determined to disclaim their authority
not doubting but he would find a ready admittance to the favour and protection of Caesar
" Scipio spoke much to the same purpose: "That Pompey was firmly bent not to abandon the republic, if he found the senators ready to support him
but if they cooled, or were remiss in their resolves, it would be in vain for them to expect his aid, if they saw cause afterwards to apply for it
" This speech of Scipio, as the senate was held in the city, and Pompey resided in the suburbs, was considered as coming from Pompey's own mouth
Some were for following milder counsels, of which number was  Marcellus, who gave it as his opinion: "That it was not proper to enter upon the present deliberation, till troops were raised over all Italy, and an army got ready, under whose protection the senate might proceed with freedom and safety in their debates
" " Callidius was for sending Pompey to his government, to take away all occasion of discord
because Caesar had reason to fear, as two of his legions had been taken from him, that Pompey retained them in the neighbourhood of Rome, with a view to employ them against him
"  Rufus nearly agreed with Callidius
But they were all severely reprimanded by the consul Lentulus, who expressly refused to put Callidius's motion to the vote
Marcellus, awed by the consul's reprimand, retracted what he had said
Thus the clamours of Lentulus, the dread of an army at the gates of Rome, and the menaces of Pompey's friends, forced the greater part of the senate, though with the utmost reluctance and dislike, into a compliance with Scipio's motion: " That Caesar should be ordered to disband his army before a certain day then fixed
and that in case of disobedience, he should be declared an enemy to the republic
"  Antonius and  Cassius, tribunes of the people, opposed their negative to this decree
Immediately a debate arose, upon the validity of their interposition
Many severe speeches were made against them
and the more warm and passionate any one appeared, the more was he applauded by Caesar's enemies
In the evening the senate rose
and Pompey sending for all those of his party, commended the forward
confirmed them in their resolutions
reproved and animated the more moderate
Multitudes of veterans, who had formerly served under him, flocked to him from all parts, allured by the expectation of rewards and dignities
A great number of officers belonging to the two legions lately returned by Caesar, had likewise orders to attend him
Rome was filled with troops
Curio assembled the tribunes to support the decree of the people
On the other hand, all the friends of the consuls, all the partizans of Pompey, and of such as bore any ancient grudge to Caesar, repaired to the senate: by whose concourse and votes the weaker sort were terrified, the irresolute confirmed, and the greater part deprived of the liberty of speaking their mind freely
Piso the censor, and  Roscius the pretor, offered to go and acquaint Caesar with the state of affairs, demanding only six days for that purpose
Some were for sending deputies to him, to inform him of the senate's disposition
But all these proposals were rejected, because the consul, Scipio, and Cato, declared against them
Cato was incited by the remembrance of an old quarrel, and the disappointment he had sustained in standing candidate for the pretorship with Caesar
Lentulus was oppressed with debt, and flattered himself with the command of armies, the government of provinces, and the largesses of the kings for whom he should procure the title of allies and friends of the Roman people
He was besides wont to boast, among those of his own party, that he doubted not of becoming a second Sylla, in whom the whole authority of the commonwealth should centre
Scipio entertained the same hope of commands and governments, which he expected to share with his son-in-law Pompey: added to this his dread of a prosecution
his vanity and selfconceit
and the flatteries and applauses of his friends, who at that time bore a considerable sway in the commonwealth and courts of justice
Pompey himself, instigated by Caesar's enemies, and not able to endure an equal dignity, was now entirely alienated from him, and had joined with their common adversaries, most of whom Caesar had contracted during his affinity with Pompey
Beside, the fraudulent step he had taken, in detaining, for the purposes of his own ambition, the two legions destined to serve in Asia and Syria, determined him to use all his endeavours to bring on a civil war, Thus nothing but tumult and violence was to be seen in the public debates
Caesar's friends had no time given them to inform him of what passed
Even the tribunes themselves were not exempt from danger, nor durst they have recourse to that right of intercession, which Sylla had left them, as the last bulwark of liberty
insomuch that the seventh day after entering upon their office, they saw themselves obliged to provide for their safety
whereas in former times, the most turbulent and seditious tribunes never began to apprehend themselves in danger, till towards the eighth month of their administration
Recourse was had to that rigid and ultimate decree which was never used but in the greatest extremities, when the city was threatened with ruin and conflagration: "That the consuls, the pretors, the tribunes of the people, and the proconsuls that were near Rome, should take care that the commonwealth received no detriment
" This decree passed the seventh of January
so that during the first five days in which it was permitted the senate to assemble, after Lentulus's entrance upon the consulship, (for two days are always appropriated to the holding of the comitia,) the most severe and rigorous resolutions were taken, both in relation to Caesar's government, and the tribunes of the people, men of eminent worth and dignity
The tribunes immediately quitted the city, and fled to Caesar, who was then at Ravenna, waiting an answer to his late demands, whose equity he hoped would dispose all parties to entertain thoughts of peace
The following days the senate assembled without the city, where Pompey confirmed everything he had before intimated by the mouth of Scipio
He applauded the resolution and courage of the senators, acquainted them with the state of his forces, that he had ten legions already in arms, and was besides well informed, that Casar's troops were by no means satisfied with their general
nay, had even refused to support and follow him
It was then proposed in the senate, that troops should be raised over all Italy
that Faustus Sylla should be sent propretor into Mauritania
that Pompey should be supplied with money out of the public treasury, and that king Juba should be declared friend and ally of the people of Rome: but Marcellus opposed the last of these
and Philippus, tribune of the people, would not agree to the propretorship of Sylla
The other motions were approved by the senate
The affair of the provinces was next decided
two of which were consular, the rest pretorian
Syria fell to the share of Scipio, and Gaul fell to  Domitius
Philippus and Marcellus were set aside, through the private views of the prevailing party
The rest of the provinces were assigned to men of pretorian rank
who waited not to have their nomination confirmed by the people, as had been the custom in former years, but after taking the usual oath, departed for their several commands in a military habit
The consuls left the city, a thing unheard of till that time, and lictors were seen walking before private men in the forum and capitol, contrary to the express practice of former ages
Troops were levied over all Italy, arms enjoined, money demanded of the colonies and free towns, and even taken from the very temples
in fine, neither divine nor human rights were regarded
Caesar having intelligence of these proceedings, addressed himself to his troops: "He took notice of the many injuries he had received on all occasions from his enemies, who had alienated Pompey from him, by filling him with an envy and jealousy of his reputation, though he had done every thing in his power to promote his glory, and favour his advancement to the highest dignities
He complained of the new precedent introduced into the commonwealth, in checking, and hindering by arms, the opposition of the tribunes, which of late years had been restored to its wonted force
That Sylla, who had almost annihilated the tribuneship, had yet left it the liberty of opposition
whereas Pompey, who valued himself upon the re-establishment of that office, deprived it now of a privilege it had always enjoyed
That the decree enjoining the magistrates to provide for the safety of the commonwealth, which implied an order to the Roman people to repair to arms, was never wont to be used but on occasion of dangerous laws, seditious measures pursued by the tribunes, or a general secession of the people, when they possessed themselves of the temples and places of strength
crimes, which in former ages had been expiated by the fate of Saturninus and the Gracchi
That at present nothing of this kind had been attempted, nor so much as thought of
no law promulged, no endeavour used to seduce the people, no appearance of revolt or disaffection
He therefore conjured them to defend against the malice of his enemies, the honour and reputation of a general, under whom they had served nine years with so much advantage to the commonwealth, gained so many battles, and subdued all Gaul and Germany
" The soldiers of the thirteenth legion, who were present, and whom he had sent for in the beginning of the troubles, (the rest not being yet arrived,) cried out, that they were determined to maintain the honour of their general, and to revenge the wrongs done to the tribunes
Being assured of the good will of the soldiers, he marched with that legion to Rimini, where he was met by the tribunes of the people, who had fled to him for protection He ordered the other legions to quit their winter quarters, and follow him with all expedition
While he was at Rimini, young  Caesar, whose father was one of his lieutenants, came to him
and after acquainting him with the occasion of his journey, added, that he had a private message to him from Pompey, "who was desirous of clearing himself to Caesar, that he might not interpret those actions as designed to affront him, which had no other aim but the good of the commonwealth: that it had been his constant maxim, to prefer the interest of the republic to any private engagement: that it was worthy of Caesar, to sacrifice his passion and resentment to the same noble motive
and not prejudice the commonwealth, by pushing too far his revenge against his private enemies
" He added something more to the same purpose, mingled with excuses for Pompey
The pretor Roscius joined likewise in the negotiation, declaring he was commissioned so to do
Though all this tended little to redress the injuries of which Caesar complained, yet considering these as proper persons by whom to transmit his thoughts, he begged of them, that as they had not scrupled to bring Pompey's demands to him, they would likewise carry back his proposals to Pompey
that, if possible, so small a labour might put an end to mighty differences, and deliver all Italy from the fear of a civil war
He told them "That the interest of the commonwealth had always been dearer to him than life
but he could not help grieving at the malice of his enemies, who had frustrated the good intentions of the Roman people in his favour, by cutting off six months from his command, and obliging him to return to Rome to sue for the consulship, though a law had been made dispensing with his personal attendance
that he had yet, for the sake of the commonwealth, patiently submitted to this assault upon his honour
that even his proposal of disbanding the armies on both sides, which he had made by a letter to the senate, had been rejected: that new levies were making over all Italy: that two legions, which had been taken from him, under pretence of the Parthian war, were still retained in the service of his enemies: that the whole state was in arms
What could all this aim at but his destruction ? That, nevertheless, he was ready to agree to any proposal, and expose himself to any danger, for the sake of his country
Let Pompey go to his government: let all the armies be disbanded: let every body throughout Italy lay down their arms: let every thing that participates of terror and force be removed: let the elections of magistrates he made with perfect freedom
and let the republic be administered by the authority of the senate and people
And the better to settle all these articles, and corroborate them with the sanction of an oath, let either Pompey himself draw nearer
or suffer Ceesar to approach him
as all their differences may be most easily terminated by a conference
" Roscius and  Caesar, having received this answer, departed for Capua, where they found Pompey and the consuls, and laid before them Caesar's proposals
After deliberating upon the affair, they sent a reply, in writing, by the same messengers, the purport of which was: "That Caesar should quit Rimini, return to Gaul, and disband his army
which conditions performed, Pompey would go into Spain
In the meantime, till Caesar gave security for the performance of what he had promised, neither Pompey nor the consuls would discontinue the levies
" It was, by no means, a fair proposal, that Caesar should be obliged to quite Rimini and return to Gaul, while Pompey held provinces and legions that were none of his: that he should dismiss his army, whilst the other was levying troops: and, that only a general promise of going into Spain should be given, without fixing a day for his departure
by which evasion, was he to be found in Italy, even at the expiration of Caesar's consulship, he could not yet be charged with breach of faith
His forbearing too to appoint a time for a conference, and declining to approach nearer, gave little reason to hope for a peace
He therefore sent Antony to Arretium, with five cohorts
remained himself at Rimini, with two, where he resolved to levy troops
and seizing Pisaurum, Fanum, and Ancona, left a cohort in each for a garrison
Meantime, being informed that Thermus the pretor had entered Iguvium, with five cohorts, and was endeavouring to fortify the town
as he knew the inhabitants to be well inclined to his interest, he detached Curio thither, with three cohorts, drawn from Lisaurum and Rimini
Upon this, Thermus, who could not confide in the townsmen, retired with his cohorts, and quitted the place: but his troops abandoning him in their march, returned severally to their own homes
Curio was received into the place with great demonstrations of joy: which being reported to Caesar, as he found he had the good will of the colonies and free towns, he drew the cohorts of the thirteenth legion out of garrison, and marched to Auximum, which Attius held with a body of troops, and whence he had despatched senators to levy forces overall Picenum
Caesar's arrival being known, the chief citizens of Auximum went in a body to Attius Varus, and told him: " That it did not belong to them to determine on which side justice lay
but that neither they, nor the other municipal towns, could endure to see their gates shut against Caesar, who by his great actions had deserved so well of the commonwealth: that therefore he would do well to consult his own safety and reputation
" Attius, moved by this speech, drew off his garrison and fled
But some of Caesar's first ranks pursuing him, obliged him to stop
and a battle ensuing, he was deserted by his men
Some of the troops returned home
the rest went over to Caesar, and brought along with them  Pupius, first centurion of the legion, who had formerly held the same rank in Pompey's army
Caesar commended Attius's soldiers: dismissed Papius: returned thanks to the inhabitants of Auximum
and promised to retain always a grateful remembrance of their attachment
These things being reported at Rome, the consternation was so great over the whole city, that when the consul Lentulus came to the treasury, to deliver out the money to Pompey, in consequence of the decree of the sepate, he scarce waited the opening of the inner door, but precipitately left the place, upon a false rumour, that Caesar was approaching, and some of his cavalry already in view
He was soon followed by his colleague Marcellus, and the greater part of the magistrates, Pompey had left the town the day before, and was upon his way to Apulia, where he had quartered the legions he had received from Caesar
The levies were discontinued within the city, and no place appeared secure on this side Capua
Here, at last, they took courage and rallied, and began to renew their levies in the colonies round about, which had been sent thither by the Julian law
Lentulus summoned into the forum the gladiators whom Caesar had ordered to be trained up there, gave them their liberty, furnished them with horses, and commanded them to follow him
But being afterwards admonished by his friends that this step was universally condemned, he dispersed them into the neighbouring town of Campania, to keep garrison there
Caesar meanwhile leaving Auximum, traversed the whole country of Picenum
where he was joyfully received in all parts by the inhabitants, who furnished his army with every thing necessary
Even Cingulum itself, a town founded by Labienus, and built at his own expense, sent deputies to him, with an offer of their submission and services
He demanded a certain number of soldiers, which were sent immediately
Meantime the twelfth legion joined him
and with these two he marched to Asculum, a town of Picenum
Here Lentulus Spinther commanded with ten cohorts
who, hearing of Caesar's approach, quitted the place with his troops, who almost all deserted him upon the march
Being left with only a few, he fell in with Vibullius Rufus, whom Pompey had sent into Picenum to encourage his followers in those parts
Vibullius understanding from him the state of affairs in Picenum, dismissed Lentulus, and took the soldiers under his command
He likewise drew together from the neighbouring provinces as many as he could meet with of Pompey's levies: among the rest, Lucilius Hirus, who was flying, with six cohorts, from Camerinum, where they had been quartered
Out of all these he formed thirteen cohorts, with which he posted, by great journeys, to Corfinium, where Domitius Ahenobarbus commanded
whom he informed that Caesar was approaching with two legions
Domitius had already got together, with great expedition, twenty cohorts from Alba, the country of the Marsi, Peligni,and the neighbouring provinces
Caesar having made himself master of Asculum, and obliged Lentulus to retire, ordered the soldiers who had deserted him, to be sought after, and new levies to be made
He remained only one day there, to settle what related to provisions, and then pursued his march to Corfinium
Upon his arrival there, he found five cohorts, whom Domitius had detached from the garrison, employed in breaking down a bridge about three miles distant from the town
But Caesar's advanced parties attacking them, they quickly abandoned the bridge, and retired to Corfinium
Caesar having passed with his legions, halted before the town, and encamped under the walls
Upon this, Domitius engaged, by great rewards,persons well acquainted with the country, to carry letters into Apulia to Pompey, wherein he earnestly requested him to come to his aid
He told him, "That it would be easy, in that close country, to shut up Caesar between two armies, and cut off his provisions: that unless this course was followed, he himself, with above thirty cohorts, and a greatnumber of senators and Roman knights, would be exposed to imminent danger
" Meanwhile,having encouraged his men, he disposed engines along the walls, appointed every one his particular post, and, the more to animate them, promised each soldier four acres of land out of his own estate, and, in proportion, to every centurion and volunteer
Meantime Caesar was informed that the people of Sulmona, a town seven miles distant from Corfinium, desired to put themselves under his protection, but were restrained by  Lucretius, a senator, and Attius, a Pelignian, who held them in subjection with a garrison ot seven cohorts
He therefore despatched  Antony thither, with five cohorts of the seventh legion, whose ensigns were no sooner descried from the walls of Sulmona, than the gates were thrown open, and the whole people in a body, both soldiers and townsmen, came out to congratulate Antony on his arrival
Lucretius and Attius endeavoured to escape over the wall: but Attius being taken, and brought to Antony, requested that he might be sent to Caesar
Antony returned the same day, bringing along with him the cohorts and Attius
Caesar joined these cohorts to his army, and set Attius at liberty
Caesar resolved to employ the three first days in strongly fortifying his camp, in procuring corn from the neighbouring towns, and waiting the arrival of the rest of his forces
During this space, the eighth legion joined him, with two and twenty cohorts of new levies from Gaul, and about three hundred horse from the king of Noricum
This obliged him to form a second camp on the other side of the town, under the command of Curio
The remaning days were spent in drawing a line with redoubts round the place, which work was nearly completed when the messengers, that had been sent to Pompey, returned
Domitius, perusing the despatches, thought proper to dissemble the contents, and declared, in council, that Pompey would speedily come to their assistance
Meantime he exhorted them to behave with courage, and provide every thing necessary for a vigorous defence
He conferred, however, privately with a few of his most intimate friends, and, in concert with them, determined upon flight
But as his looks and speech were found to disagree
as he behaved not with his usual composure and firmness
and was observed, contrary to custom, to be much in secret conference with his friends
avoiding public appearances, and councils of war: it was not possible for the truth to remain any longer concealed
For Pompey had wrote back, "That he could not put all to hazard for his sake
that he had neither advised nor consented to his shutting himself up in Corfinium
that he must therefore endeavour to extricate himself as well as he could, and come and join him with all his forces
" But as Caesar had invested and carried his lines round the place, this retreat was now become impracticable
Domitius's design being discovered, the soldiers who were at Corfinium began to assemble in the evening, and, by means of their tribunes, centurions, and other officers, made known their thoughts to one another: "That they were besieged by Caesar, who had already, in a manner, completed his works: that their general, Domitius, in whose promises of assistance they had placed their chief hope, abandoning all concern for their safety, was contriving to escape privately by flight: that it was therefore incumbent upon them to look also to their own preservation
" The Marsi at first opposed this resolution, and possessed themselves of the strongest part of the town
nay, the dispute was so warm, that it almost came to be decided by the sword
But shortly after, being made accquainted with Domitius's intended flight, of which before they had no knowledge
they all, in a body, surrounded Domitius, secured his person, and sent deputies to Caesar: "That they were ready to open their gates, receive his orders, and deliver up Domitius alive
" Though Caesar was fully sensible of how great importance it was to get possession of the town immediately, and join the garrison to his own army
lest by largesses, promises of speedy relief, or false reports, any change should be produced
as in war great revolutions often arise from very trifling causes: yet, fearing that if he introduced his soldiers in the dark, they would take that opportunity to plunder the town, he sent back the deputies, with thanks for their proffer, resolving to have the walls and gates watched with great care
To that end he disposed his men along the works, not at a certain distance, as usual, but in one continued rank, so as to touch each other, and completely invest the town
He ordered the military tribunes, and officers of the cavalry, to patrol about the works, and not only be on their guard against sallies, but even take care to prevent the escape of particular persons
And indeed so alert and vigilant were our soldiers, that not a man closed his eyes that night
each expecting the event with impatience, and carrying his thoughts from one thing to another
what would be the fate of the Corfinians, what of Domitius, what of Lentulus, and the other illustrious persons in the place: in fine, what was like to be the issue of so complicated a scene
About the fourth watch of the night, Lentulus Spinther called from the wall to the guard, and desired to be conducted to Caesar
His request being granted, he came out of the town, attended by some of Domitius's soldiers, who never left him till they had conducted him into Caesar's presence
He begged him to spare his life, and pardon the injuries he had done him, in consideration of their former friendship
He owned the many obligations he had laid him under, in procuring him an admission into the college of priests, obtaining for him the government of Spain, after the expiration of the pretorship, and supporting him in the demand of the consulship
Caesar interrupted him by saying: "That he was not come out of the bounds of his province, with an intent to injure any body
but to repel the injuries done him by his enemies
to revenge the wrongs of the tribunes
and to restore to the Roman people, who were oppressed by a small faction of the nobles, their liberties and privileges
" Lentulus, encouraged by this speech, asked leave to return into the town, "where, he said, the assurances he had obtained of his own safety, would contribute not a little to the consolation of others, some of whom were so terrified, that they were ready to take desperate resolutions
" Leave being granted, he departed for the town
As soon as it was light, Caesar ordered before him all the senators, senators' sons, military tribunes, and Roman knights
There were ofsenatorian rank,  Domitius,  Lentulus Spinther,  Vibullius Rufus, Sextus Quintilius Varus, questor,  Rubrius
also Domitius's son, and many young men of quality, with a great number of Roman knights, and some decurions, or senators of the neigbouring municipal towns, who had been sent for by Domitius
As soon as they appeared, he gave orders to secure them from the insults of the soldiery
and, addressing them in a few words, remonstrated: "That they had made a very ill requital for the many signal services received at his hands
" After which, he set them at liberty
He likewise restored to Domitius six millions of sesterces, which that general had brought with him to Corfinium, and deposited in the hands of the two treasurers of the town, who surrendered it to Caesar
As this was public money, assigned by Pompey to pay the forces with, Caesar might justly have seized it
but he was willing to show himself generous, as well as merciful
He ordered Domitius's soldiers to take the usual oath to him, decamped that very day
made the ordinary march
and after staying in all seven days before Corfinium, arrived in Apulia, through the territories of the Marrucini, Frentani, and Larinates
Pompey, having intelligence of what passed at Corfinium, retreated from Luceria to Canusium, and from thence to Brundusium
He ordered all the new levies to join him, armed the shepherds and slaves, furnished them with horses, and formed a body of about three hundred cavalry
Meanwhile the pretor  Manlius flying from Alba, with six cohorts
and the pretor Rutilus Lupus, from Tarracina, with three
saw Caesar's cavalry at a distance, commanded by Bivius Curius: upon which, the soldiers immediately abandoned the two pretors, and joined the troops under the conduct of Curius
Several other parties, flying different ways, fell in, some with the foot,otherswith the horse
Cn
Magius of Cremona, Pompey's chief engineer, being taken on his way to Brundusium, was brought to Caesar, who sent him back to Pompey with this message: "That as he had not yet obtained an interview, his design was to come to Brundusium, there to confer with him in relation to the common safety
because they soon would be able to despatch, in a personal treaty, what, if managed by the intervention of others, could not be hindered from running into a tedious negotiation
" Having dismissed him with these instructions, he arrived before Brundusium with six legions, three of which were composed of veteran soldiers, and the rest of new levies drawn together upon his march
for as to Domitius's troops, he had sent them directly from Corfinium to Sicily
He found the consuls were gone to Dyrrhachium with great part of the army, and that Pompey remained in Brundusium with twenty cohorts
Nor was it certainly known whether he continued there with design to keep possession of Brundusium, that he might be master of the whole Adriatic Sea, the extreme parts of Italy, and the country of Greece, in order to make war on both sides the gulf
or for want of shipping to transport his men
Fearing, therefore, that it was his intention to keep footing in Italy he resolved to deprive him of the advantages he might receive from the port of Brundusium
The works he contrived for this purpose were as follows: He carried on a mole on either side the mouth of the haven where the entrance was narrowest, and the water shallow
But as this work could not be carried quite across the port, by reason of the great depth of the sea, he prepared double floats of timber, thirty feet square, which were each secured by four anchors from the four corners, to enable them to resist the fury of the waves
These, extending all the way between the two moles, were covered over with earth and fascines, that the soldiers might pass and repass with ease, and have firm footing to defend them
The front and sides were armed with a parapet of hurdies, and every fourth float had a tower of two stories, the better to guard the work from fire and the shocks of the vessels
Against these preparations, Pompey made use of several large ships which he found in the port of Brundusium: and having fi ted them with towers of three stories, which he filled with a great number of engines and darts, let them loose upon Caesar's floats, to break through the staccado, and interrupt the works
Thus daily skirmishes happened with darts, arrows, and slings, at a distance
Amidst these hostilities, Caesar's thoughts were still bent upon peace
and though he could not but wonder that Magius, whom he had sent with proposals to Pompey, was not yet returned with an answer
and even saw his designs and undertakings retarded by his frequent offers of this kind, he nevertheless still persevered in these peaceable resolutions
Accordingly, he despatched Caninius Rebilus, one of his lieutenants, a relation and intimate friend of Scribonius Libo, to confer with him on this subject
He charged him to exhort that nobleman to think seriously of peace, and, if possible, procure an interview between him and Pompey
Could this be effected, he showed there was the greatest ground to believe that peace would soon be concluded on reasonable terms
the honour and reputation of which would in a manner wholly redound to Libo, if, by his mediation, both parties slould be prevailed with to lay down their arms
Libo, after conferring with Caninius, waited on Pompey: soon after he returned with this answer
that the consuls were absent, without whom Pompey had no power to treat of an accommodation
Thus Caesar having often tried in vain to bring about a peace, thought it now time to drop that design, and bend all his thoughts to war
Caesar having spent nine days about his works, had now half finished the staccado, when the ships employed in the first embarkation, being sent back by the consuls from Dyrrhachium, returned to Brundusium
Pompey, either alarmed at Caesar's works, or because from the first he had determined to relinquish Italy, no sooner saw the transports arrive, than he prepared to carry over the rest of his forces
And the better to secure himself against Caesar, and prevent his troops from breaking into the town during the embarkation, he walled up the gates, barricaded the streets, or cut ditches across them, filled with pointed stakes, and covered with hurdles and earth
The two streets which led to the port and which he left open for the passage of his men, were fortified with a double palisado of very strong well sharpened stakes
These preparations being made, he ordered the soldiers to embark with great silence, having placed on the walls and towers some select archers and slingers, who were to wait till all the troops had got aboard, and then retire, upon a signal given, to some small ships that waited them at a convenient distance
The people of Brundusium, provoked by the affronts they had received from Pompey, and the insults of his soldiers, wished well to Caesar's cause
and having notice of Pompey's intended departure while the soldiers were busied with the care of embarking, found means to signify it from the tops o their houses
Caesar, upon this intelligence, ordered scaling ladders to be prepared, and the soldiers to repair to their arms, that he might not lose any opportunity of acting Pompey weighed anchor a little before night, and gave the signal for recalling the soldiers that were upon the walls, who repaired with all expedition to the ships prepared for them
Meantime the scaling ladders are applied to the walls, and Caesar's troops enter the town
But being informed by the Brundusians of the snares and ditches provided for them by the enemy, they were obliged to take a great circuit, which gave Pompey time enough to put to sea
Two transports only, impeded by Caesar's mole, were taken with the troops on board
Though Caesar was fully sensible, that to finish the war at a blow, he must pass the sea immediately, and endeavour to come up with Pompey, before he could draw his transmarine forces together
yet he dreaded the delay and length of time that such a project might require
because Pompey having carried with him all the ships on the coast, rendered the present execution of the design impracticable
He must therefore wait the arrival of ships from Picenum, Sicily, and the remoter coasts of Gaul, which was a tedious business, and, at that season of the year, subject to great uncertainty
It appeared likewise of dangerous consequence, to suffer a veteran army, and the two Spains, one of which was wholly devoted to Pompey, to strengthen themselves in his rival's interest
to let them grow powerful by levies of horse and foot, and leave Gaul and Italy open to their attacks in his absence
He determined, therefore, to lay aside, for the present, the design of pursuing Pompey, and turn all his thoughts towards Spain
He ordered the magistrates of the municipal towns to assemble all the vessels they could, and send them to Brundusium
He sent Valerius, one of his lieutenants, into Sardinia, with one legion, and the propretor Curio into Sicily with three, ordering him, as soon as he had mastered Sicily, to pass over with his army into Africa
Cotta commanded in Sardinia
Cato in Sicily
and Africa had fallen by lot to Tubero
The inhabitants of Cagliari, hearing of Valerius's commission, of their own accord, before he had left Italy, drove Cotta out of their city
who terrified by the unanimous opposition he met with from the province, fled into Africa
In Sicily, Cato applied himself with great diligence to the refitting of old ships, and building of new
He sent his lieutenant to raise forces in Lucania, and the country of the Brutians, and ordered the states of Sicily to furnish him with a certain number of horse and foot
When these preparations were almost completed, being informed of Curio's arrival, he called his chief officers together, and complained, " That he was betrayed and abandoned by Pompey, who, without any previous preparation, had involved the commonwealth in an unnecessary war
and upon being questioned by himself and others in the senate, had assured them, that he was abundantly able to sustain it
" Having thus declared his mind, he quitted the province, which by this means submitted without trouble to Curio, as Sardinia had before done to Valerius
Tubero arriving in Africa, found Attius Varus in possession of that province, who, after the loss of his cohorts at Auximum, as we have shown above, had fled into those parts, and, with the consent of the natives, taken upon him the command
Here he had found means to levy two legions, by his knowledge of the people and country, where he had been governor some years before, after the expiration of his pretorship
Tubero coming before Utica with his fleet, was forbid the harbour and town
nor could he even obtain leave for his son to land, though he had a fit of sickness upon him, but was obliged to weigh anchor and be gone
These affairs despatched, Caesar that his troops might enjoy some repose, cantoned them in the nearest towns, and set out himself for Rome
There he assembled the senate, and after complaining of the injuries of his enemies, told them, "That he had never affected extraordinary honours, but waited patiently the time prescribed by the laws, to solicit for a second consulship, to which every Roman citizen had a right to aspire: that the people, with the concurrence of their tribunes, (in spite of the attempts of his enemies, and the vigorous opposition of Cato, who endeavoured, according to custom, to spin out the time in speaking,) had permitted him to stand candidate though absent, and that even in the consulship of Pompey
who, if he disapproved of the decree, why did he let it pass? But if he allowed it, why now oppose the execution ? He set before them his moderation, in voluntarily proposing that both parties should lay down their arms, by which he must have been himself divested of his government and command
He displayed the malice of his enemies, who sought to impose terms on him, to which they would not submit themselves
and chose rather to involve the state in a civil war than part with their armies and provinces
He enlarged upon the injury they had done him, in taking away two of his legions, and their cruelty and insolence, in violating the authority of the tribunes
He spoke of his many offers of peace, his frequent desire of an interview, and the continual refusals he had received
For all these reasons, he requested and conjured them to undertake the administration of the republic, jointly with him
But if they declined it through fear, he had no intention to force so great a burden upon them, and would take the whole charge alone
That in the mean time it would be proper to send a deputation to Pompey, to treat of an accommodation: nor was he frighted at the difficulty Pompey had started some time before in the senate
that to send deputies was to acknowledge the superiority of him to whom they were sent, and a sign of timidity in the sender
That this was a little low way of thinking
and that, in the same manner as he had endeavoured at a superiority in action, he would also strive to be superior in justice and equity
" The senate liked the proposal of a deputation to Pompey
but the great difficulty was, to find deputies
every one, out of fear, refusing to charge himself with that commission
For Pompey, at his departure from Rome, had declared in the senate, "That he would esteem those who stayed beind, as no less guilty than those in Caesar's camp
" Thus three days were spent in debates and excuses
The tribune  Metellus had likewise been suborned by Caesar's enemies to traverse his design, and hinder whatever he should propose
Which Caesar coming to understand, and that he only wasted his time to no purpose
he set out from Rome, without effecting what he intended, and arrived in farther Gaul
Here he was informed, that Pompey had sent into Spain Vibullius Rufus, the same who, a few days before, had been made prisoner at Corfinium, and set at liberty by Caesar
that Domitius was gone to take possession of Marseilles, with seven galleys, which he had fitted out at Igilium and Cosanum, and manned with his slaves, freedmen, and labourers
that the deputies of the above-mentioned state, young men of the first quality, (whom Pompey, at his departure from Rome, had exhorted not to suffer the memory of his past services to their country to be blotted out by those lately received from Caesar,) had been sent before, to prepare the way for his reception
In consequence of their remonstrances, the inhabitants of Marseilles shut their gates against Caesar, and summoned to their assistance the Albici, a barbarous people, who had long been under their protection, and inhabited the adjoining mountains
They brought provisions from the neighbouring country and castles, refitted their navy, and repaired their walls and gates
Caesar sending for fifteen of the principal men of the city, exhorted them not to be the first to begin the war, but to be swayed rather by the authority of all Italy, than the will of one particular person
He forgot not such other considerations as seemed most likely to bring them to reason
The deputies returning into the town, brought back this answer from the senate: "That they saw the Romans divided into two parties, and it did not belong to them to decide such a quarrel: that at the head of these parties were Pompey and Caesar, both patrons of their city, the one having added to it the country of the Vulcae Arecomici and Helvians
the other after the reduction of Gaul, considerably augmented its territories and revenues
that as they were therefore equally indebted to both, it became them not to aid the one against the other
but to remain neuter, and grant neither an admittance into their city nor port
" Whilst these things were in agitation, Domitius arrived at Marseilles with his fleet, and being received into the town, was appointed governor, and charged with the whole administration of the war
By his order, they sent out their fleet to cruise round the coasts
seized and brought in all the merchant vessels they could find, and made use of the nails, rigging, and timber, of such as were unfit for service, to repair the rest
They deposited in public granaries, all the corn that was to be found in the city, and secured whatever else they thought might be serviceable to them in case of a siege
Caesar, provoked at these preparations, brought three legions before the town, began to erect towers and galleries, and gave orders for building twelve galleys at Arles, which being finished, launched, and brought to Marseilles, within thirty days from the cutting of the wood they were composed of, he put them under the command of  Brutus, and having directed the manner of the siege, left the care of it to  Trebonius, his lieutenant
During these orders and preparations, he sent  Fabius before him into Spain, with three legions that had wintered about Narbonne, charging him to secure with all diligence the passage of the Pyrenean Mountains, which was at that time guarded by a party of Afranius's army
His other legions, whose quarters were more remote, had orders to follow as fast as they could
Fabius, according to his instructions, having made great despatch, forced the passes of the Pyrenees, and by long marches came up with Afranius's army
Pompey had then three lieutenants in Spain, Afranius, Petreius, and Varro
The first of these was at the head of three legions, and governed the nearer Spain
The other two had each two legions, and commanded, the one from the Castilian Forest to the Anas
the other from the Anas, quite through Lusitania, and the territories of the Vettones
These three lieutenants, upon the arrival of Vibullius Rufus, whom Pompey had sent into Spain, as we have, seen above, consulted together, and agreed, that Petreius should join Afranius with his two legions, and that Varro should stay and secure farther Spain
These resolutions being taken, Petreius levied horse and foot in Lusitania, and Afranius in Celtiberia, and the barbarous nations bordering upon the ocean
When the levies were completed, Petreius speedily joined Afranius, through the territories of the Vettones
and both resolved to make Lerida the seat of the war, because the country lay convenient for their purpose
We have already observed that Afranius had three legions, and Petreius two
Besides these, there were about eighty cohorts, some light, some heavy armed, and five thousand horse, raised in both provinces
Caesar had sent his legions before him into Spain, with six thousand auxiliary foot, and three thousand horse, who had served under him in all his former wars, and he was furnished with the like number from Gaul, all chosen troops
For hearing that Pompey was coming with his whole force through Mauritania into Spain, he sent circular letters to all the Gallic states, inviting by name those of the most known and approved valour, and in particular a select body of mountaineers from Aquitain, where it borders upon the Roman province
At the same time he borrowed money from the military tribunes and centurions, which he distributed among the soldiers
This policy was attended with two great advantages: it bound the officers to him by the obligation of interest, and the soldiers by the tie of gratitude
Fabius, by letters and messengers, endeavoured to sound the disposition of the neighbouring states
He had laid two bridges over the Sicoris, four miles distant from each other, for the convenience of foraging, having consumed all the pasture on this side the river
Pompey's generals did the same, with much the like view, which occasioned frequent skirmishes between the horse
Two of Fabius's legions, which was the ordinary guard of the foragers, passing one day according to custom, and the cavalry and carriages following, the bridge broke down on a sudden, by the violence of the winds and floods, and separated them from the rest of the army
Afranius and Petreius perceiving it, by the fascines and hurdles that came down with the stream
detached immediately four legions, with all their cavalry, over the bridge that lay between the town and their camp, and marched to attack Fabius's legions
Upon this,  Plancus, who commanded the escort, finding himself hard pressed, seizing a rising ground, and forming his men into two divisions, posted them back to back, that he might not be surrounded by the enemy's horse
By this disposition, though inferior in number, he was enabled to sustain the furious charge of their legions and cavalry
During the course of the battle, the ensigns of two legions were perceived at a distance, which Fabius had sent by the farther bridge to sustain his party, suspecting what might happen, and that Pompey's generals might seize the opportunity offered them by fortune, to fall upon our men
Their arrival put an end to the engagement, and both parties returned to their respective camps
Two days after, Caesar arrived in the camp with nine hundred horse, which he had kept for a body guard
He began by re-establishing in the night the bridge which had been broken down, and was not yet quite repaired
Next day he took a view of the country, and leaving six cohorts to guard the bridge, the camp, and the baggage, marched with all his forces in three lines to Lerida, and stopped near Afranius's camp, where he remained some time under arms, and offered him battle on an even ground
Afranius drew out his troops, and formed them before his camp, half way down the hill
Caesar, finding that he declined an engagement, resolved to encamp within four hundred paces of the foot of the mountain
and to hinder his troops from being alarmed or interrupted in their works, by sudden incursions from the enemy, ordered them not to throw up a rampart, which must have appeared and betrayed them at a distance, but to cut a ditch in front, fifteen feet broad
The first and second lines continued in order of battle, as had been resolved from the beginning, and the third carried on the work behind them unperceived
Thus the whole was completed, before Afranius had the least suspicion of his design to encamp there
In the evening, Caesar retreated with his legions behind the ditch, and passed the whole night under arms
Next day he carried the intrenchment quite round his camp, and because materials for a rampart must have been fetched from a great distance, he contented himself for the present with a naked ditch, as the day before, allotting a legion to each side of the camp, and keeping the rest of the troops under arms, to cover those that worked
Afranius and Petreius, to alarm our men and disturb the works, advanced with their troops to the foot of the mountain, and threatened to give battle, But Caesar, trusting to the three legions under arms, and the defence of the ditch, still persisted in his design
At last, after a short stay, and without daring to come forward into the plain, they retreated again to their camp
The third day, Caesar added a rampart to his camp, and brought into it the six cohorts, with the baggage which he had left in his former camp
Between the city of Lerida, and the hill where Petreius and Afranius were encamped was a plain of about three hundred paces, in the midst of which was a rising ground, which Caesar wanted to take possession of
because, by that means, he could cut off the enemy's communication with the town and bridge, and render the magazines they had in the town useless
In this hope, he drew out three legions, and having formed them in order of battle, commanded the first ranks of one of them to run before, and gain the place
Afranius perceiving his design, despatched the cohorts that were upon guard before the camp, a nearer way to the same eminence
The contest was sharply maintained on both sides: but Afranius's party, who first got possession of the post, obliged our men to give ground, and being reinforced by fresh supplies, put them at last to rout, and forced them to fly for shelter to the legions
The manner of fighting of Afranius's soldiers was, to come forward briskly against an enemy, and boldly take possession of some post, neither taking care to keep their ranks, nor holding it necessary to fight in a close compact body
If they found themselves hard pushed, they thought it no dishonour to retire and quit their posts, following in this the custom of the Lusitanians, and other barbarous nations, as it almost always happens, that soldiers give in to the manners of the country where they have long been used to make war
This manner of fighting, however, as it was new and unexpected, disordered our men, who seeing the enemy come forward, without regard to their ranks, were apprehensive of being surrounded, and yet not think themselves at ensigns, or quit their post, without some very urgent cause
The first ranks therefore being put into disorder, the legion in that wing gave ground, and retired to a neighbouring hill
Caesar, contrary to his expectation, finding the consternation like to spread through the whole army, encouraged his men, and led the ninth legion to their assistance
He soon put a stop to the vigorous and insulting pursuit of the enemy, obliged them to turn their backs, and pushed them to the very walls of Lerida
But the soldiers of the ninth legion, elated with success, and eager to repair the loss we had sustained, followed the runaways with so much heat that they were drawn into a place of disadvantage, and found themselves directly under the hill where the town stood, whence when, they endeavoured to retire, the enemy again facing about, charged vigorously from the higher ground
The hill was rough, and steep on each side, extending only so far in breadth as was sufficient for drawing up three cohorts
but they could neither be reinforced in flank, nor sustained by the cavalry
The descent from the town was indeed something easier for about four hundred paces, which furnished our men with the means of extricating themselves from the danger into which their rashness had brought them
Here they bravely maintained the fight, though with great disadvantage to themselves, as well on account of the narrowness of the place, as because being posted at the foot of the hill, none of the enemy's darts fell in vain
Still however they supported themselves by their courage and patience, and were not disheartened by the many wounds they received
The enemy's forces increased every moment, fresh cohorts being sent from the camp through the town, who succeeded in the place of those that were fatigued
Caesar was likewise obliged to detach small parties to maintain the battle, and bring off such as were wounded
The fight had now lasted five hours without intermission, when our men, oppressed by the multitude of the enemy, and having spent all their darts, attacked the mountain sword in hand, and overthrowing such as opposed them, obliged the rest to betake themselves to flight
The pursuit was continued to the very walls of Lerida, and some out of fear took shelter in the town, which gave our men an opportunity of making good their retreat
At the same time the cavalry, though posted disadvantageously in a bottom, found means by their valour to gain the summit of the mountain, and riding between both armies, hindered the enemy from harassing our rear
Thus the engagement was attended with various turns of fortune
Caesar lost about seventy men in the first encounter, among whom was  Fulginius, first centurion of the Hastati of the fourteenth legion, who had raised himself by his valour to that rank, through all the inferior orders
Upwards of six hundred were wounded
On Afranius's side was slain  Caecilius, first centurion of a legion
also four centurions of inferior degree, and above two hundred private men
Yet such were the circumstances of this day's action, that both sides laid claim to the victory
the Afranians, because, though allowed to be inferior in number, they had long sustained our attack, kept possession of the eminence which occasioned the dispute, and obliged our men at first to give ground: Caesar's troops, because they had maintained a fight of five hours, with a handful of men, and in a very disadvantageous post
because they had attacked the mountain sword in hand
because they had driven their adversaries from the higher ground, and compelled them to take shelter in the town
Meantime Afranius fortified the hillock which had been the subject of dispute, with a great number of works, and posted there a large body of troops
Two days after, a very unfortunate accident happened
For so great a storm arose, that the water was never known to be higher in those parts
and the snow came down in such quantities from all the mountains round about, that the river overflowed its banks, and in one day broke down both the bridges Fabius had built over it
Caesar's army was reduced to great extremities on this occasion
For his camp, as we have before observed, was between the Sicoris and Cinga, two rivers that were neither of them fordable, and necessarily shut him up within the space of no more than thirty miles
By this means, neither could the states that had declared for him supply him with provisions, nor the troops that had been sent beyond the rivers to forage, return, nor the large convoys he expected from Gaul and Italy get to his camp
Add to all this, that it being near the time of harvest, corn was extremely scarce and the more, as before Caesar's arrival, Afranius had carried great quantities of it to Lerida
and the rest had been consumed by Caesar's troops
The cattle, which was the next resource in the present scarcity, had been removed to places of security, on the breaking out of the war
The parties sent out to forage and bring in corn, were perpetually harassed by the Spanish infantry, who being well acquainted with the country, pursued them every where
The rivers themselves did not impede them, because they were accustomed to pass them on blown-up skins, which they always brought with them into the field
Afranius, on the contrary, abounded in all things
He had large magazines of corn already laid up, was continually receiving fresh supplies from the province, and had plenty of forage
The bridge of Lerida furnished all these conveniences without danger, and opened a free communication with the country beyond the river, from which Caesar was wholly excluded
The waters continued several days
Caesar endeavoured to re-establish his bridges, but could not get the better of the obstacles occasioned by the swelling of the river, and the enemy's forces stationed on the opposite bank
They found it the easier to prevent his design, as the river was deep and rapid, and they could discharge their darts all along the bank, on that particular spot where our men were at work: whereas it was extremely difficult on our side to struggle with the force of the stream, and, at the same time, guard ourselves against the assaults of the enemy
Meanwhile Afranius was informed that a large convoy, which was on its way to join Caesar, had been obliged to halt at the river side
It consisted of archers from Rovergue, Gaulish horse, with many carts and much baggage, according to the custom, of the Gauls, and about six thousand men of all sorts, with their domestics and slaves
but without discipline or commander, every one following his own choice, and all marching in perfect security, as if they had nothing more to apprehend than in former times
There were likewise many young gentlemen of quality, senators' sons, and Roman knights, with the deputies of the states of Gaul, and some of Caesar's lieutenants
who were all stopped night, with three legions, and all his cavalry
and sending the horse before, attacked them when they least expected it
The Gaulish squadrons, forming with great expedition, began the fight
While the contest was upon equal terms, the Gauls, though few in number, bore up against the vast multitude of the enemy
but seeing the legions advance, and having lost some of their men, they retreated to the neighbouring mountains
This delay saved the convoy, for during the skirmish, the rest of the troops gained the higher ground
We lost that day about two hundred archers, a few troopers, and some servants and baggage
All this served to enhance the price of provisions, a calamity inseparable from present scarcity, and the prospect of filture want
Corn was already at fifty denarii a bushel, the soldiers began to lose their strength, and the evil increased every moment
Nay, so great was the change produced in a few days, and such the alteration of fortune, that while our men were in the utmost want of all kind of necessaries, the enemy had plenty of every thing, and were accounted victorious
Caesar left nothing untried to remove the present scarcity: he dismissed all the useless mouths, and applied to the states that had declared for him, desiring them to send him cattle where they wanted corn
These things were greatly exaggerated by Afranius, Petreius, and their friends, in the letters they sent, upon this occasion, to Rome
Nor was fame backward in adding to the account
insomuch that the war appeared to be almost at an end
These couriers and letters having reached Rome there was a great concourse of people at Afranius's house, many congratulations passed, and multitudes of the nobility flocked out of Italy to Pompey
some to carry the first accounts of this grateful news
others, that they might not be so late as to subject them to the reproach of having waited for the event of things
Affairs being in this extremity, and all the passes guarded by Afranius's parties, without a possibility of repairing the bridges
Caesar ordered the soldiers to build some light boats, in imitation of those he had formerly seen in Britain, whose keel and ribs were of wood, and the rest of wicker, covered with leather
When he had got a sufficient number, he sent them by night in waggons, twenty-two miles off from his camp
In these he embarked a good number of soldiers, and sent them over the river
took possession unexpectedly of a hill adjoining to the bank on the other side
threw up a fortification before the enemy thought of hindering him
posted a legion in this fortification
and then threw a bridge over the Sicoris in two days
By this means he recovered his foragers, secured the convoy, and opened a passage for future supplies
The same day he detached a great part of his cavalry over the river
who, falling unexpectedly upon the enemy's foragers, dispersed up and down, without a suspicion of danger, made a considerable capture of men and horses
and observing some Spanish cohorts on the march to their assistance, skilfully divided themselves into two bodies
one to secure the booty
the other, to receive and return the enemy's charge
One of their cohorts, which had rashly separated from the rest, and advanced too far before the main body, was surrounded and cut to pieces by our men, who returned over the same bridge to the camp, without loss, and enriched with a considerably booty
Whilst these things passed at Lerida, the people of Marseilles, by the advice of  Domitius, equipped seventeen galleys, eleven of which were covered
To these they added a multitude of smaller vessels, that they might strike a terror into our fleet by their very number
and manned them with archers, and the mountaineers we have already mentioned, whom they encouraged to perform their part by great rewards and promises
Domitius desired some of these ships, and filled them with the shepherds and labourers he had brought thither with him
Thus furnished and equipped, they sailed with great confidence, in quest of our fleet, which was commanded by Decimus Brutus, and rode at anchor at an island over against Marseilles
Brutus was much inferior to the enemy in number of ships
but Caesar had manned them with his best soldiers, chosen out of all the legions, and headed by centurions of distinguished bravery, who had petitioned him for this service
These had provided themselves with hooks and grapplingirons, and a great number ofdarts,javelins, and offensive weapons of all sorts
Thus prepared, upon notice of the enemy's arrival, they stood out to sea, and attacked their fleet
The conflict was sharp and vigorous
For the mountaineers, a hardy race, habituated to arms, and trained up in war, scarce yielded to the Romans in bravery
and, having but just parted from Marseilles, still retained a lively sense of the promises so lately made them
The shepherds too, animated by the hopes of liberty, and fighting under the eye of their master, did wonders to merit his approbation
The townsmen themselves, confiding in the nimbleness of their ships, and the skill of their pilots, eluded the shock of our vessels, and baffled all their attempts
As they had abundance of sea-room, they extended their line of battle, in order to surround our fleet, or attack our ships singly with a number of theirs, or in running along-side, sweep away a range of oars
If they were compelled to come to a closer engagement, setting aside the skill and address of their pilots, they relied wholly on the bravery of their mountaineers
Our men were but indifferently provided with rowers and pilots, who had been hastily taken out of some merchant ships, and knew not so much as the names of the tackle
They were incommoded too by the weight and lumpishness of their vessels, which being built in haste, of unseasoned timber, were not so ready at tacking about
But when an opportunity offered of coming to close fight, they would boldly get between two of the enemy's ships
and grappling them with theirhooks, charge them on each side, board them, and cut to pieces the mountaineers and shepherds that defend them
In this manner they sunk part of their vessels, took some with all the men on board, and drove the rest into the haven
In this engagement, the enemy had nine galleys sunk or taken
The report of this battle reaching Lerida, and Caesar having finished his bridge over the Sicoris, affairs soon began to put on a new face
The enemy dreading the courage of our horse, durst not disperse about the country as formerly
but either foraged in the I neighbourhood of the camp, that they might the sooner make good their retreat
or, by a long circuit, endeavoured to avoid our parties: and upon receiving any check, or even descrying our cavalry at a distance, they would throw down their trusses, and fly
At last, they were reduced to omit foraging several days together, and resolved to pursue it of war
In the mean time the Oscenses and Calagurritani, jointly sent deputies to Caesar
with an offer of their submission and services
The Tarraconenses, Jacitani, and Ausetani, and not many days after, the Illurgavonenses, who inhabit along the banks of the Iberus, followed their example
He only required them to supply him with corn, to which they readily agreed
and having got together a great number of carriage-horses, brought it to his camp
A cohort of the Illurgavonenses, hearing of the resolution taken by their state, deserted from the enemy, and came over to Caesar's camp
The change was sudden and great
for, the bridge being finished, provisions secured, this rumour of Pompey's march through Mauritania extinguished, and five considerable states having declared in his favour
a great number of distant provinces renounced their engagements with Afranius, and entered into new ones with Caesar
These things having struck a terror into the enemy
that he might not be always obliged to send his cavalry so far about to forage, the bridges lying about seven miles from his camp, he bethought himself of draining the river, by turning some of its water into canals thirty feet deep, so as to make it fordable
The work being almost completed, Petreius and Afranius grew extremely apprehensive of being entirely cut off from their provisions and forage, because Caesar was very strong in cavalry
They therefore thought proper to quit a post that was no longer tenable, and to carry the war into Celtiberia
What contributed still further to confirm them in this resolution was, that of the two contrary parties, concerned in the late war,those who had declared for Sertorius, still trembled at the name of the conqueror, and dreaded his power, though absent
and those who had attached themselves to Pompey, continued to love him for the many services he had done them: but Caesar's name was hardly known among these barbarians
Here they expected considerable reinforcements of horse and foot
and doubted not, by taking the advantage of places, to be able to protract the war till winter
In order to execute this plan, they collected all the boats to be found on the Iberus, and ordered them to be brought to Octogesa, a city on that river, about twenty miles from their camp
Here they commanded a bridge of boats to be built
and, having sent two legions over the Sicoris, fortified their camp with a rampart of twelve feet
Caesar, having notice of this by his scouts, laboured day and night at his drains with the utmost diligence
and had already so far diminished the water of the Sicoris, that the cavalry could, with some difficulty, pass over: but it took the infantry as high as the shoulders, who had therefore both the depth of the river, and the rapidity of the stream to struggle with
Meanwhile it was known, that the bridge over the Iberus was almost finished, and Caesar's ford in great forwardness
This was a fresh motive to the enemy to quicken their march: wherefore, leaving two auxiliary cohorts, for a garrison, at Lerida, they crossed the Sicoris with all their forces, and joined the two legions they had sent over before
Caesar had now no other remedy left but to harass and fatigue them with his cavalry: for if he went with his whole army over his bridge, he lengthened his march prodigiously, and gave Afranius time enough to get to the Iberus
Accordingly the horse having forded the river, came up with Petreius and Afranius's rear, who had decamped about midnight
and making a motion to surround them, began to stop and retard their march
At day-break we discovered from the hills near the camp, that the enemy's rear was greatly harassed by our cavalry
Sometimes they obliged them to halt, and disordered their ranks: at other times, the enemy facing about, charged with all their cohorts at once, and forced our men to give ground
who, wheeling again as soon as they began to march, failed not to renew the attack
At this sight, the legionary soldiers, running up and down the camp, complained that the enemy would escape out of their hands, and the war necessarily be prolonged
They addressed themselves to the centurions and military tribunes, and desired them to beg of Caesar not to spare them
that they feared neither danger nor fatigue, and were ready to pass the river as the horse had done
Caesar, moved by their alacrity and entreaties, though he saw some danger in exposing his army to the rapidity of a deep river, judged it yet proper to attempt and make trial of the passage
Having therefore withdrawn from every company such as were weak of body, or of less courage than the rest, he left them in the camp with the army happily passed the river, by the assistance of a double line of cavalry, placed above and below them
Some of the infantry were carried away by the violence of the current
but they were picked up and saved by the horse below them
so that no one man was lost
Having passed the river without loss, he drew up his army in order of battle, and began to pursue the enemy in three lines: and such was the ardour of the soldiers, that notwithstanding the army was obliged to make a circuit of six miles, notwithstanding the time necessarily lost in crossing the river, they got up at the ninth hour of the day to the enemy, who had set out at midnight
When Afranius and Petreius perceived them at some distance, being with reason intimidated, they suspended their march, halted on an eminence, and formed in order of battle
Caesar would not hazard an action with his troops, thus fatigued, and halted likewise in the plain
On this the enemy resumed their march, and he the pursuit
which obliged them to encamp earlier than they designed
Hard by was a range of mountains, and about five miles farther, the ways were difficult and narrow
The enemy retired among these mountains, to avoid the pursuit of the cavalry
and having placed parties in all the passes, to stop Caesar's army, hoped, by this means, to continue their march to the Iberus, without fear or danger
This was their great affair, and what before all things they should have endeavoured to effect but, being fatigued by a long march, and their continual skirmishes with Caesar's cavalry, they deferred it till next day
Caesar likewise encamped on a hill that lay near him
About midnight, the cavalry having surprised some of the enemy, who had adventured a little too far from their camp in quest of water
Caesar was informed by them, that Pompey's lieutenants were decamping without noise
Immediately he ordered the alarm to be sounded, and gave his army the signal to march
The enemy, finding they should be pursued, kept still
being afraid of a nocturnal flight, wherein they would have had greatly the disadvantage, on account of their heavy baggage which they had with them, and the superiority of Caesar's cavalry
Next day, Petreius went privately out with a party of horse, to take a view of the country
Caesar pose, under the command of Decidius Saxa
Both made the like report in their several camps
that for five miles together, the country was level and open, but after that rough and mountainous
and that whoever should first get possession of the defiles might easily prevent the other army from approaching them
Upon this, a council of war was held by Petreius and Afranius, to deliberate about the time of beginning their march
The greater number were for setting out by night, in hopes of reaching the defiles before Caesar ould have notice of their departure
Others argued against the possibility of decamping privately, by the alarm given in Caesar's camp the night before: "That the enemy's cavalry were continually patrolling in the night, and had beset all the ways and passes: that a nocturnal engagement was to be avoided, because, in a civil war, the soldiers were more apt to listen to their fears, than the obligations of the military oath: that shame and the presence of the centurions and tribunes, the great instruments of obedience and military duty, could have their proper effect only in the light, which rendered it of infinite importance to wait the approach of day
that in case of a disaster, yet the bulk of the army would escape, and be able to possess themselves of the post in question
" This opinion prevailed in the council, and they resolved to set out the next morning by break of day
Caesar having taken a view of the country, decamped as soon as it was light, taking a considerable circuit and observing no particular route
for the direct way to the Iberus and Octogesa lay in the rear of the enemy's camp
He was therefore obliged to march through valleys and precipices, and over steep rocks, which the soldiers could not climb, but by disencumbering themselves of their arms, and returning them afterwards to one I another
But not a man murmured at these difficulties, in hopes of seeing a speedy end of all their labours, if they could but gain the Iberus before the enemy, and intercept their provisions
As in this march we pursued at first an opposite course, and seemed to turn our backs upon the enemy, Afranius's soldiers who observed us from their camp, came forth with joyful looks, and insulted us on our supposed flight, imagining the want of provisions obliged us to return to Lerida
Their generals applauded themselves upon their resolution of not decamping, and were confirmed in the notion of our retreat, as they saw we had neither horses nor carriages
whence they concluded the scarcity must be exceeding great
But when they saw us, after some time, turn to the right, and that our advanced guard had already gained the ground beyond their camp, there was not a man so tardy or indolent, as not to perceive the necessity of decamping and opposing our march
Immediately they ran to arms, and leaving a few cohorts to guard the camp, sallied in a body, pursuing their way directly to the Iberus
All depended upon despatch, and getting the first possession of the defiles and mountains
Our troops were retarded by the difficulties of the way, and Afranius's by the continual attacks of Caesar's cavalry
But such was the situation of the Afranians, that even supposing them to gain the hills first, they could only secure their own retreat, without a possibility of preserving their baggage, and the cohorts left to guard the camp
because Caesar's army getting between, cut them off from all communication with their own men
Caesar arrived first at the place in question
and having found a plain beyond the rocks, formed his men in order of battle against the enemy
Afranius, who now saw our army in his front, at the same time that his rear was continually harassed by the cavalry, halted on an eminence, from whence he detached four Spanish cohorts, to take possession of the highest mountain thereabouts
ordering them to make all the despatch they could to seize it, that he might get thither himself with the rest of his forces, and changing his route, march them over the hills to Octogesa
The Spaniards wheeling obliquely, to take possession of the place, were perceived by Caesar's cavalry
who charged them furiously, broke them at the first onset, surrounded, and cut them in pieces in sight of both armies
Caesar had now an opportunity of giving the enemy an effectual blow
whose army, in the present consternation it was under, would, he was sensible, make but a faint resistance
more especially as it was surrounded on all sides by the cavalry, and would be obliged to fight on equal ground
He was pressed, on all hands, to give the signal
The lieutenants, centurions, and military tribunes got round him, urging him not to delay the engagement: "That the soldiers were all eager for a battle
whereas, on the contrary, the Afranians had given many marks of fear: that they had neither dared to support their own detachment, nor offered to descend from the hill, nor been able to withstand the very first charge of our cavalry
that they had brought their ensigns all into one place where they crowded confusedly round them, without observing ranks or order: that if he was afraid to attack them on the eminence, he would soon have an opportunity of more equal ground, as Afranius would be obliged to remove for want of water
" Caesar was in hopes of terminating the affair without bloodshed, or a battle
because he had intercepted the enemy's provisions
Why therefore, even supposing the event to be prosperous, should he unnecessarily lose any of his men? Why should he expose to wounds, soldiers who had so well deserved of him? Why, in fine, should he tempt fortune? especially as it redounded no less to the honour of a good general, to gain the victory by his conduct, than by the force of his arms
He was also touched with compassion for Afranius's soldiers
who after all, were fellow-citizens, and whom he must have slaughtered, when he could equally succeed without touching their lives
This resolution was not at all relished by the army
who, in their discontent, openly declared, that since Caesar did not lay hold of so favourable an opportunity, nor let them fight when they had a mind, they would not fight when he had a mind
But nothing could shake him
Nay, he even retreated a little, to give Afranius and Petreius liberty to regain their camp, which they did
He then posted troops on the mountains, to guard the defiles
and came and encamped as near the enemy as possible
The day after, Pompey's lieutenants, disturbed at finding their provisions cut off, and all the ways to the Iberus intercepted, consulted what was proper to be done
They had it still in their power to return to Lerida, or march to Tarraco
But while they were debating this matter, notice was brought them, that our cavalry had fallen upon their parties sent out in quest of water
Upon this intelligence, they formed several posts of horse and foot, intermixed with legionary cohorts
and to the place where they watered, that the soldiers might pass and repass under cover, without fear, and without a guard
Afranius and Petreius divided this work between them, and went to give directions about it in person
In their absence, their soldiers found frequent opportunities of conversing with our men, and sought out every one his fellowcitizen and acquaintance
They began by thanking them for having spared them the day before, owning they were indebted to them for their lives
Afterwards they asked them, if they might trust to Caesar's honour
testifying much grief at being obliged to fight with their countrymen and relations, with whom they were united by the strictest ties
At last they stipulated even for their generals, whom they would not seem to betray: and promised, if the lives of Petreius and Afranius were granted them, to change sides
At the same time they sent some of their principal officers to negotiate with Caesar
and these preliminaries to an accommodation being settled, the soldiers of both armies went into one another's tents, so that the two camps were now in a manner one
A great number of centurions and military tribunes came to pay their court to Caesar, and beg his protection
The Spanish chiefs, who had been summoned to attend Afranius, and were detained in the camp as hostages, followed their example
Every man sought out his acquaintance and friend, who might recommend and procure him a favourable reception from Caesar
Things were carried to such a length, that Afranius's son, a young gentleman, treated with Caesar, by the mediation of Sulpicius, to desire he would give his word for his life, and that of his father
The joy was general
they mutually congratulated each other
the one, in that they had escaped so imminent a danger
and the other, in that they had brought to a happy conclusion so important an enterprise, without striking a blow
Caesar, in the judgment of all, was upon the point of amply reaping the fruits of his wonted clemency, and every body applauded his late conduct
Afranius, having notice of what passed, quitted the work he was engaged in, and returned to the camp
prepared, as it would seem, to bear with an equal mind not wanting to himself
He armed his slaves
and joining them to a pretorian cohort of target-bearers, and some Spanish horse, his dependents, whom he always kept about him to guard his person
he instantly flew to the rampart, broke off the conferences of the soldiers, drove our men from the camp, and put all of them he could find to the sword
The rest flocked together
where, alarmed at the danger to which they saw themselves exposed, they wrapped their cloaks round their left arms, drew their swords, and, trusting to the nearness of their camp, defended themselves against the Spanish target-bearers and cavalry, till they had retreated to our advanced guard, who screened them from any further assault
After this he went through the whole camp, begging his troops, with tears, to have pity on him, and Pompey their general
and that they would not deliver them both up to the cruel vengeance of their enemies
Every one upon this flocks to the head-quarters
There Petreius proposes to the army to bind themselves by a new oath, not to abandon nor betray their commanders, nor to act separately, but all in concert, for the common good
He himself took this oath first, and then exacted it of Afranius, afterwards of the military tribunes and centurions, and lastly of all the companies, man by man, At the same time an order was issued that all who had any of Caesar's soldiers in their tents should signify it, that they might be put to death in the sight of the whole army
But the majority detesting this bloody order, carefully hid those who were under their protection, and procured them means to escape in the night
However, the terror they had been thrown into by their generals, the severity shown in punishing, and the new oath they had been obliged to take, defeated, for the present, all hopes of a surrender, changed the soldiers' minds, and reduced the war to its former state
Caesar ordered diligent search to be made after such of the enemy's soldiers as had come to his camp during the time of conference, and carefully sent them back
Some military tribunes and centurions voluntarily chose to stay with him
whom he afterwards treated with great distinction
promoting the centurions to higher ranks, and honouring the Roman knights with the office of military tribunes
The Afranian troops were destitute of forage, and could not water without much difficulty
The legionary soldiers had, indeed, some provisions, because they had been ordered to bring two and twenty days' corn with them from Lerida
but the Spanish infantry and auxiliaries had none
for they neither had opportunities of supplying themselves, nor were their bodies inured to carry heavy burdens
Accordingly, they every day deserted in shoals to Caesar
In this extremity, of the two expedients proposed, that of returning to Lerida appeared the safest, as they had still some provisions in that city, and might there concert what further measures to pursue
Tarraco was at a greater distance, and they would of course be exposed to more accidents by the way
This resolution being taken they decamped
Caesar sent the cavalry before, to harass and retard them in their march
and followed himself with the rest of the army
The cavalry gave the enemy no respite, being continually engaged with their rear
The manner of fighting was thus: Some light-armed cohorts formed the rearguard, which, in a plain, halted from time to time, and made head against our cavalry
When they fell in with an eminence, the very nature of the ground furnished them with the means of defending themselves, because those who were first could, cover them behind
But when a valley or descent came in the way, the van could give no assistance to the rear, and our cavalry annoyed them with their darts from the higher ground, which put them in imminent danger
In this case, the legions were obliged to halt, and endeavour to drive back the cavalry a good way, after which they ran down the valley precipitately, until they came to the opposite eminence
For their cavalry, of which they had a considerable number, was so terrified by their ill success in former skirmishes, that, far from being of any service, they were forced to place it in the centre to secure it
and if any of them chanced to straggle from the main body, they were immediately taken by Caesar's horse
During these continual skirmishes, in which the enemy were often obliged to halt, in order to disengage their rear, it is easy to perceive that their march could not be very expeditious
This was in fact the case
so that after advancing four miles, finding themselves greatly incommoded by the cavalry they halted on an eminence, and drew a line before them, as it were to encamp, but did not unload their beasts of burden
When they saw that Caesar had marked out his camp, pitched his tents, and sent his cavalry to forage
suddenly, towards noon, they resumed their march briskly, hoping to be rid of the cavalry which had so much incommoded them
But Caesar set out immediately with his legions, leaving a few cohorts to guard the baggage, and sent orders to his cavalry to return with all diligence
The cavalry returned accordingly, and having overtaken the enemy before the close of day, attacked their rear so vigorously, that they were almost routed, a great number of soldiers, and even some centurions being slain
Caesar's whole army came up, and threatened them with an immediate attack
As they could then neither choose a proper place for a camp, nor continue their march, they were forced to halt where they were, far from any water, and on very disadvantageous ground
Caesar did not offer to attack them, for the reasons mentioned before: he would not even permit any tents to be pitched that day, that he might be the readier to pursue with all his forces, should they attempt to escape either by night or by day
The Afranians perceiving the disadvantage of their situation, employed the whole night in throwing up intrenchments, and disposed their camp directly fronting ours
The same they did the following day, from sun-rise till evening
But the farther they extended their camp, and produced their lines, in order to better their position, the farther they went from water, and to avoid one inconvenience, fell into another
The first night nobody went out of the camp for water, and the next day the whole army was obliged to do it in order of battle, so that they could not forage that day
Caesar waited to humble them by these misfortunes, and reduce them by want and necessity rather than force
He began, however, to draw lines round the camp, the better to check their sudden sallies and irruptions, to which he foresaw they would be obliged to have recourse at last
Want, soon constrained them to kill all the beasts of burden
Two days were spent in forming and executing those resolutions
on the third, Caesar had considerably advanced his works
Afranius and Petreius, sensible of the consequences, drew all their forces out of the camp, and formed them in order of battle
Caesar previously called in his workmen, assembled his cavalry, and put his army in a condition to receive them, for he was aware of the hurt his reputation might sustain, if, contrary to the opinion of the troops, and the earnest expectations of all, he should still seem to decline an engagement
However, for the reasons already mentioned, he resolved to keep only upon the defensive
and the rather, because the distance between the two camps was so small, that should he even put his adversaries to rout, he could not flatter himself with the hopes of a complete victory
In fact, from camp to camp was not above two thousand feet
the armies were posted on each side of this space, which was left void for the mutual charge and assault of the soldiers
On supposition therefore of a battle, the nearness of their camp furnished an easy retreat to the vanquished
For this reason he resolved to wait the enemy's charge, and not enter the first into action
Afranius's troops were ranged in two lines, consisting of five legions, and the cohorts wont to be stationed in the wings, formed a body of reserve
Caesar's army was upon three lines
in the first of which were posted four cohorts, detached out of each of the five legions
in the second three
and in the third the like number, all from their respective legions: the archers and slingers were disposed in the midst, and the cavalry on the two wings
The armies being drawn up in this manner, each general kept firm to his resolution
Caesar, not to engage, unless forced to it
and Afranius, to prevent the progress of our works
In this posture they continued till sun-set, when both armies returned to their several camps
The next day, Caesar prepared to finish his lines
and Pompey's lieutenants, as their last resource, endeavoured to find a fordable place in the Sicoris
But Caesar, penetrating their design, sent his light-armed Germans, with part of good bodies of troops along the banks, at a small distance from one another
At last, having no hope left, and being in want of every thing, wood, water, forage, corn, they demanded an interview, and that it might be, if possible, in some place out of the sight of the soldiers
Caesar denied the last part of their request, but offered to grant them a public interview
whereupon Afranius, having given his son for a hostage, went to the place appointed by Caesar, where, in the presence of both armies, he addressed him to this effect: "That it was no just matter of blame, either in him or his soldiers, to have preserved their fidelity to their general, Pompey
but that they had now sufficiently acquitted themselves of their duty, and suffered enough in his cause, by the want of all kind of necessaries
that like wild beasts caught in a toil, they were deprived of the most common enjoyments, having their bodies oppressed by want, and their minds overwhelmed with ignominy, that they therefore acknowledged themselves vanquished, and besought and conjured him, not to make a rigorous use of his victory, but to spare the lives of his unhappy countrymen
" This speech was delivered with all possible marks of humility and submission
Caesar replied, "That he of all mankind, had least reason to complain, or implore compassion: that all the rest had fully done their duty
himself, in forbearing to attack him, with all the advantages of time and place, that the way to an accommodation might be the more open
his army, in returning untouched, the men that were in their power, after injuries received, and the massacre of their comrades: in fine, even his own troops, in endeavouring to conclude a peace, whereon they thought their safety depended
Thus all orders had shown an inclination to treat, while Afranius and Petreius alone opposed an accommodation, refusing both interview and truce, and barbarously murdering those whom the faith of a conference had enticed to their camp: that it had therefore happened to them, as frequently happens to men of obstinacy and arrogance, and they were forced to have recourse to those conditions, and earnestly solicit the very same terms, which not long before they had despised
However, he would not take advantage of their present submission, or the favourable circumstances in which he found himself, to demand any thing tending to the increase of his own power, but only that they would disband those troops which they had now for so many years kept on foot against him
For with what other view had six legions been sent into Spain
a seventh levied there, so many powerful navies equipped, so many able and experienced officers sent over
These mighty preparations could not be meant against Spain, or to supply the wants of the province, which having enjoyed a long run of peace, had no occasion for such extraordinary forces
Their real aim was to pave the way to his destruction
to effect which, a new species of power had been introduced into the commonwealth, and the same man appointed to command in Italy, at the gates of Rome, and hold for so many years, though absent, the government of the two most potent provinces of the republic
For this reason the magistrates were stripped of their prerogatives, and not suffered to take possession of their provinces, at the expiration of the pretorship or consulship, as had always been the custom
but particular governors were sent, by the choice and management of a faction
For this reason even the excuse of old age was disallowed
and those who had merited a discharge by their past services, were compelled to take arms again, to complete the number of their troops
In fine, for this reason, he alone had been denied that justice, which was never refused to any general before him
that after having successfully served the commonwealth, he should be allowed to return home, and disband his own army, with some marks of honour, orat least without ignominy
All which, nevertheless, he had hitherto borne, and still resolved to bear with patience
nor was it now his design, to take from them their soldiers, and enlist them, as it would be easy for him to do, but to prevent their employing them against him
Therefore, as he had already intimated, they must resolve to quit Spain, and disband their forces, in which case he would injure no man
This was his final resolution, and the only condition of peace they were to expect
" These conditions were agreeable to Afranius's soldiers, who, instead of being punished, as they feared, were in some sort rewarded by the discharge procured them
They plainly showed their satisfaction
For, while the place and time of their dismission were debating, they signified by their gestures and cries from the rampart, where they stood, that they desired to be disbanded immediately
because no sufficient security could be given for the performance of what was put off till another time
After some discussion of that article by Caesar and Afranius, it was regulated, that those who had houses or possessions in Spain, should be discharged on the spot
and the rest near the Var, a river between Gaul and Italy
Caesar, on his side, declared, that he would hurt nobody, nor force any one to take on in his service
Caesar undertook to find them in corn until they got to the Var
He even promised to restore to them all they had lost in the war, that could be known again
himself indemnifying his own soldiers, who hereby lost quired their confidence to such a degree, that he was arbiter of all the disputes they had, either among themselves, or with their commanders
The soldiers being ready to mutiny about their pay, because Petreius and Afranius affirmed it was not yet due, the matter was referred to Caesar, who determined it to the satisfaction of both parties
About a third of the army was disbanded during the two days they continued here, after which the rest set out for the Var in this order
Two of Caesar's legions marched at the head, the others in the rear, and the vanquished troops in the middle
Fufius Calenus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, presided over the march
In this manner they continued their route to the Var, where the remainder of the troops were disbanded
